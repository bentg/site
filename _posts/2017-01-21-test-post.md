Hello World!

Fellow Florentines,

Once you have learned how to write in __Markdown__, this is the sort of blog format that will be expected in your posts.
Learning Markdown isn't *that* hard, and you should be able to pick it up within an afternoon or two.

# If you have questions or need help, just ask me!
## Seriously, just ask

Markdown is neat because
- it's plaintext
- with some simple formatting
- so it's really helpful for archiving/websites
