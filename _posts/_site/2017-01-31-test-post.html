<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Fellow Florentines,</p>

<p>Once you have learned how to write in <strong>Markdown</strong>, this is the sort of blog format that will be expected in your posts.
Learning Markdown isn’t <em>that</em> hard, and you should be able to pick it up within an afternoon or two.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-have-questions-or-need-help-just-ask-me">If you have questions or need help, just ask me!</h1>
<h2 id="seriously-just-ask">Seriously, just ask</h2>

<p>Markdown is neat because</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s plaintext</li>
  <li>with some simple formatting</li>
  <li>so it’s really helpful for archiving/websites</li>
</ul>
