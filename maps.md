- Our 2-D map will be based on a late 16th-century map created by Stefano Buonsignori
- Our 3-D map will be created entirely by Washington and Lee students, using historical records, contemporary sources, and existing structures in an effort to recreate the look and feel of 15th-century Florence as closely as possible.
