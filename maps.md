Our 2-D map will be based on a collection of maps of Florence through the centuries
  + Catena
  + Carocci
  + late 16th-century map created by Stefano Buonsignori
  + ArcGIS

To see the work-in-progress, click <a href="http://arcg.is/0b4uav">here</a>.

Our 3-D map will be created entirely by Washington and Lee students, using historical records, contemporary sources, and existing structures in an effort to recreate the look and feel of 15th-century Florence as closely as possible.
