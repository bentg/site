                <p>Hello all,
Over the past few weeks Sonia and I have begun to focus more of our efforts on the actual user interface aspects of the project. When we meet with Paul in the IQ center he constantly encourages us to think about the technicalities of the program’s design, and what we can do to make it easier to use and improve the user’s experience.<!-- more --> Paul, Sam and Aidan used the maps that we layered to construct a 3D version that accurately depicts the layout of Florence, which is very useful for us to see what the program looks like as we make progress. We have thus been able to go into VR while working through problems and making decisions.
We spent several meetings focusing on the best way for the user to engage with the buildings and artworks. Paul explained to us the importance of trigger events to achieve different things in VR, and we spent some time looking at other VR programs to see what our options were and to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each, particularly as it pertains to our project. We decided that an approach that forces the user to take specific actions to gain access to the information was important, because there needs to be some way to make sure the user knows what he or she is doing. That is, we want the user to be able to successfully navigate the program to access information, as opposed to stumbling upon buildings and not really understanding what they’re doing.  </p>

<p>Paul helped us develop an example of this on the model. Here’s how it now works: As the user walks through the streets, significant buildings are colored differently than the others to identify the buildings we have modeled that can be explored. Once the user enters a specific perimeter surrounding the highlighted building, a high-resolution model of the building appears (low-resolution models are necessary otherwise to ensure the speed isn’t affected by too much data on the screen). Once this happens, a shaded area appears next to the building to indicate the location at which information can be obtained. Inside this area, an overview of the building is displayed in text, and the user can learn about the particular building before going inside the model. </p>

<p>One of the features we are excited to add once we’ve developed the program further is one that enables the user to go on virtual tours throughout the city, which essentially provides them with a checklist of things to do before they finish. This will lend itself especially useful to classes that will want to use the program, because professors can tailor each individual tour depending on who the target user will be. For instance, when a class is learning about works of art the Medici family commissioned, the professor can assign a homework project that requires students to use the VR to go look at certain artworks. The student must then read all of the information about each of the works on the list in order to receive credit for doing the assignment.  </p>

<p>In her recent blog posts, Sonia has touched on some of the limitations of using 3D for such an extensive project, which include instances in which the user might want an interface that is more useful for reading articles about the building and conducting in-depth research. We now feel that our 2D map may be a good place to start working on that project, with an eye towards imitating the format of other maps, such as this Map of London created by a group at the University of Victoria https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/. In an effort to start this, I spent a few hours last week with Professor Bent deciphering an old handmade map of Florence and labeling our own computerized map with Adobe Illustrator. This gave us a much better idea of which guilds and families were concentrated in the center of the city, and will hopefully provide a starting point from which we can dive into the project of assembling documents and resources on the different buildings.

                <h3>MC's Intro</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Mary Catherine Greenleaf, and I’d like to introduce myself and my place as a new member of the Florence As It Was project! I’m a junior studio art and computer science double major, with high dreams of entering the game design or animation fields. As such, my place in the project lies within the realm of 3D modeling. I have taken over Sam’s role in the team, learning how to effectively work with programs such as Cinema 4D, Substance Painter, SketchUp, and Unity. I will be creating 3D models of the buildings that no longer exist, based on paintings from the time, as well as creating and placing basic textures over the city map so the program won’t utilize too much processing power with smaller details, while still maintaining the overall environment.</p>

<p>That being said, I’ve made considerable progress since the beginning of the year on the aforementioned fields. After a horrible mishap with my poor laptop’s screen, I’ve recovered and began mastering the various software required of me. I’ve spent time learning SketchUp, creating a small road in the process, and Cinema 4D, placing a mapped texture over that road. It took me a while to figure out the camera controls for Substance Painter, with its user unfriendly interface, but liberal use of the ALT key proved useful for moving around. After learning the basics of Substance Painter it was determined that knowledge of that software probably will not be necessary to the beginning stages of this project, as we discovered a website which houses multiple mapped textures to place in other programs. It may still be helpful later on if we decide to create our own textures, so I’m glad to have learned it.</p>

<p>I have subsequently learned how to create and apply textures to models in Unity, the program we will be using to actually explore our 3D landscape. I downloaded a generic road texture and its accompanying maps from Gametextures.com for the sake of exploration. Hopefully in the future I will be creating our own textures for this project, though the process seems to be intense, but in the meantime this website will suffice. I had a little difficulty determining how the texture files aligned with the maps, but through trial and error I have found that files ending with certain letters link to specific layers:</p>

<p>d. -&gt; Albedo</p>

<p>n. -&gt; Normal map</p>

<p>h. -&gt; Height map</p>

<p>nY. -&gt; Secondary map</p>

<p>d. -&gt; Again in detail albedo</p>

<p>I have also spent time gaining proficiency in Cinema 4D in order to create the underlying 3D models for the buildings. Dave and I investigated UV mapping, the mechanism which allows us to effectively apply textures to oddly shaped models. Though a difficult process to learn, requiring the 2D deconstruction of 3D models, I have begun to grasp the concept. 
In the next couple of weeks I will focus on creating models of old buildings long since torn town, utilizing old paintings as my templates.</p>
