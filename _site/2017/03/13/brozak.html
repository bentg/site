                <p>As Miles and I have continued to meet with Dr. Low in the IQ Center to review various options for the ways in which viewers can interact with a digital Florentine space, we have constantly had to ask and re-ask ourselves “what do we want the viewer to get out of this experience?”

While a deceptively simple question, it gets to the shortcomings and the beauty of the three-dimensional space as a medium through which to learn about the city. A major barrier we have reached recently is idea that when looking at these art objects as high-resolution images placed in the context of other images so that they appear in situ, why don’t you just travel to Florence to see that there? Of course, the logistics of such an undertaking and the convenience of briefly transporting to the city for the purposes of a homework assignment should not be cast aside lightly. However, this tool must be evaluated in terms of how it could best be used aside from as a replacement for the actual city. </p>

<p>We attempted to create numerous types of “tours” throughout the 3D city starting from high school level going through the 300 level. Starting with the baptistry, this would look like a few images of the doors and an explanation of the competition that led to Brunelleschi and Ghiberti’s final submissions and the culmination in the doors, as well as a discussion of the use of the baptistry. For the 300-level student, there might be a discussion of the anti-pope, John XXIII’s, funerary monument on the interior, a work by Donatello and Michelozzo commissioned by Cosimo de’Medici. These varying levels of detail would allow for further guidance than any given city tour but the quick overview that visiting the city wouldn’t allow.</p>

<p>Yet, the depths of detail and the varying uses for these “tours” has given rise to more serious discussion of using the 2D map as an available resource, supplementing the 3D experience. While students could take tours and learn about the city from the ground level, the work it demands to build those tours could easily be transformed into just the basis–a map with points that allow students to find out more information and go to the sources themselves. Rather than hearing about the funerary monument ad nauseam, a student might go directly to the Jstor article and read it for her- or himself.</p>

<p>This duality would introduce a new level to the project, one in which it acts not only as a pedagogical device for lecturing but also for guiding students’ research.</p>

                <h3>MC's Intro</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Mary Catherine Greenleaf, and I’d like to introduce myself and my place as a new member of the Florence As It Was project! I’m a junior studio art and computer science double major, with high dreams of entering the game design or animation fields. As such, my place in the project lies within the realm of 3D modeling. I have taken over Sam’s role in the team, learning how to effectively work with programs such as Cinema 4D, Substance Painter, SketchUp, and Unity. I will be creating 3D models of the buildings that no longer exist, based on paintings from the time, as well as creating and placing basic textures over the city map so the program won’t utilize too much processing power with smaller details, while still maintaining the overall environment.</p>

<p>That being said, I’ve made considerable progress since the beginning of the year on the aforementioned fields. After a horrible mishap with my poor laptop’s screen, I’ve recovered and began mastering the various software required of me. I’ve spent time learning SketchUp, creating a small road in the process, and Cinema 4D, placing a mapped texture over that road. It took me a while to figure out the camera controls for Substance Painter, with its user unfriendly interface, but liberal use of the ALT key proved useful for moving around. After learning the basics of Substance Painter it was determined that knowledge of that software probably will not be necessary to the beginning stages of this project, as we discovered a website which houses multiple mapped textures to place in other programs. It may still be helpful later on if we decide to create our own textures, so I’m glad to have learned it.</p>

<p>I have subsequently learned how to create and apply textures to models in Unity, the program we will be using to actually explore our 3D landscape. I downloaded a generic road texture and its accompanying maps from Gametextures.com for the sake of exploration. Hopefully in the future I will be creating our own textures for this project, though the process seems to be intense, but in the meantime this website will suffice. I had a little difficulty determining how the texture files aligned with the maps, but through trial and error I have found that files ending with certain letters link to specific layers:</p>

<p>d. -&gt; Albedo</p>

<p>n. -&gt; Normal map</p>

<p>h. -&gt; Height map</p>

<p>nY. -&gt; Secondary map</p>

<p>d. -&gt; Again in detail albedo</p>

<p>I have also spent time gaining proficiency in Cinema 4D in order to create the underlying 3D models for the buildings. Dave and I investigated UV mapping, the mechanism which allows us to effectively apply textures to oddly shaped models. Though a difficult process to learn, requiring the 2D deconstruction of 3D models, I have begun to grasp the concept. 
In the next couple of weeks I will focus on creating models of old buildings long since torn town, utilizing old paintings as my templates.</p>
