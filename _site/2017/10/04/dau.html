                <p>My name is Katherine, and I am a junior art history major with a minor in German language. For this project, I will largely be replacing Sonia (big shoes to fill) and will be working to translate Paatz <em>The Churches of Florence</em> and other German writers into English.
<!-- more -->
 Information from the Paatz collection will provide us with detailed accounts of the buildings of Florence. Although apprehensive, I am excited to translate such a dense source of information. I have begun with the entry on the Baptistery of St. John, as it is the building on which we are currently focused. This week, I truly dove in for my first attempts. It took me some time to unscramble one sentence and relearn the future perfect tense. Additionally, I plan to make a key for abbreviations as those posed a challenge for me in the endnotes. It has become clear that I have my work cut out for me, but I am confident that understanding will come with practice.</p>

<p>In addition to German translation, I will also be working with Aidan on website design and management. While the translation aspect of the project is relatively familiar to me, the web design and 3D modeling aspects of the project are entirely foreign territory. As such, I have sough to educate myself on the subject. In attending a meeting with MC, Dave, and Sam a few weeks ago, I discovered just how little I knew. I assumed that photogrammetry was the blanket term for all 3D modeling. Dave demonstrated UV Mapping and modeling on Cinema 4D and other programs. Later in the day, I met with Aidan to talk about web design. He introduced me to how he runs the website, explaining CSS and HTML languages. With the help of Mackenzie Brooks, Aidan, and a textbook that he loaned me, I hope to be fluent in these new languages soon.</p>

                <h3>A Morning in Siena</h3>
                <p>Hello World</p>

<p>Aidan, Colby, and I have been very busy since we arrived in Florence three weeks ago. After finishing up the term in Lexington, the three of us met Professor Bent here in Florence. We hit the ground running and began photographing the Bargello the very next morning.</p>

<p>Professor Bent worked with our drone pilot Fabrizio Pacetti with assistance from Francesca Pacetti to capture the upper stories of the building, while Aidan, Colby, and I worked on the south and east sides. We struggled to align our settings on our cameras to get similar picture color. As we moved up the building and the sun got higher, the light changed, altering the white balance of the photo. The stone façade of the Bargello also poses a major problem to us. The building has massive walls comprised entirely of brick-sized stones of the same color. PhotoScan, our photogrammetry software, will struggle to recognize the sequence of these photos because there are not enough distinguishing features on the façade. Later in the morning (around 8:15), the three of us returned to the Bargello to photograph the Cappella del Podestà for a model. After struggling with the camera on areas of loss in the fresco, the three of us really found our rhythm. Once we finished the chapel, we shot Verrocchio’s <em>Ginevra de’ Benci</em>, or <em>Lady of the Primroses</em>.</p>

<p>A few day later, the three of us put our practice with the Cappella del Podestà to the test. Armed with our cameras and the BLK laser scanner, the FLAW team headed to Siena to attempt to model four rooms in the Palazzo Pubblico. Colby, Aidan, and I began with the Sala de Nove. While we struggled with the light at first, the room went relatively well. The Capella and Anticapella posed new problems. It seemed almost every inch of both rooms was covered with frescos by Taddeo di Bartolo. The ceilings were vaulted, and frescos adorn archways leading to other rooms. The level of detail in this space makes it a wonderful subject for photogrammetry. With a digital model, viewers will be able to view closely view the details works on the ceiling or behind ropes. However, it was an incredible challenge to model the space accurately. While the Sala de Mappemonde was more regular, it poses new lighting issues as an entire wall is covered with large, open windows. These prevent accurate photos from being taken of the wall. We completed the job after four hours of photographing and called it a day.</p>

<p>Looking at the models, some of the potential issues that we identified proved to be problematic while other aspects modeled quite well. The Capella ceiling turned out excellently, but the lower portion and the floor were too dark for the camera to pick up accurately. This resulted in a lava-like runoff on some of the lower edges of the model. The Sala de Mappemonde also had areas of issue of the major window wall. This portion of the room will have to be photographed earlier, and on a cloudier day. We will happily make a return trip to Siena to attempt to resolve these issues in our model. For now, we will continue to work on the Bargello, Orsanmichele, and the Baptistery in Florence, and I will continue to work on Paatz.</p>
