      <h2 id="baptism-in-florence">Baptism in Florence</h2>

<p>The ritual of baptism was a crucial feature of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Florence. This symbolic practice carried both a spiritual and social weight integral for full participation in the fabric of Florentine society. Baptism was not only a means of defense against hellfire, but an introduction to civic society and a foundational moment in each individual’s life. While some of the finer details of the practice are unclear to contemporary scholars, we now know that by 1128 the ritual was performed at the octagonal Baptistery of San Giovanni, located directly across from the cathedral.</p>

      <h2>Andrea di Bonaiuto: </h2>
      <p>#Andrea di Bonaiuto (ca. 1325-1379)
##Painter</p>

<p>Born around 1325, the painter Andrea di Bonaiuto survived the bubonic plague which swept through Florence in 1348 and worked in Pisa and Florence until his death in 1379. Relatively few archival records of his life remain, and he signed and dated virtually none of his works. However, his most significant achievement, the fresco cycle in the chapterhouse of Santa Maria Novella (for which documents do survive), serves as one of the great artistic triumphs of the <em>Trecento</em>, and provides important insights into Florentine religious life.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Andrea entered the Florentine <a href="insert link">Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries</a> in 1346 and, beginning in 1351, lived in the quarter of Santa Maria Novella that was named for the great basilica of the Dominican Order. His work bears resemblance to that of <a href="insert link">Nardo di Cione (ca. 1320-1365)</a>, another Florentine artist with whom he may have apprenticed. Andrea left Florence in 1355 to work in Pisa for roughly ten years. When he returned in 1365, he received the commission to decorate the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse, now known as the <a href="insert link">Spanish Chapel</a>. In return for his work, <a href="insert link">Zanobi Guasconi</a>, the prior of Santa Maria Novella at the time, granted Andrea and his wife a house valued at sixty-five florins (the modern equivalent of roughly $130,000). Andrea’s contract stated that he complete the project within a period of two years, beginning on January 1, 1366, and he appears to have honored this stipulation.</p>

<p>The Dominican chapterhouse served as one of the focal points of daily Dominican life and ritual. Many liturgical and ceremonial functions took place there, as well as the day-to-day administration of the chapter. Upon the arrivals of prominent visitors, the Dominicans would have guided their guests first to the chapterhouse, the center of their organization. Thus, the pictures that decorated the chapterhouse would have been seen by the Dominicans on a daily basis and would represent their chapter to visitors.</p>

<p>Although one of the Dominicans probably devised the mural cycle’s sophisticated program, their decision to commission Andrea for the chapterhouse decorations demonstrates their esteem for him and his work. Scenes from the <em>Passion of Christ</em> make up the cycle’s central image, with images of the <em>Way to Calvary</em>, the <em>Crucifixion</em>, and the <em>Harrowing of Hell</em> covering the north wall of the chapel. Other images such as the <a href="insert link"><em>Via Veritatis</em></a> depict Saints Dominic, Peter Martyr, and Thomas Aquinas celebrating the intellectual and spiritual triumphs of the Order. In the same year he received the chapterhouse commission, civic leaders in Florence appointed Andrea to a <a href="insert link">committee</a> tasked with designing the dome for Florence’s cathedral. He served as a committee member for two years until 1367, and the representation of the domed cathedral in the <em>Via Veritatis</em> surely reflects his own conception of how that cupola ought to have looked.</p>

<h2 id="andrea-spent-brief-periods-of-the-next-ten-years-working-in-both-orvieto-and-pisa-upon-his-death-in-1379-he-left-behind-only-a-meager-sum-for-his-widow-and-child-suggesting-that-andreas-expenses-largely-outpaced-his-revenues-despite-the-rather-quiet-end-to-his-career-andreas-frescos-on-the-walls-of-santa-maria-novellas-chapterhouse-document-dominican-identity-preserve-examples-of-their-particular-world-view-and-present-their-take-on-larger-issues-of-christian-ideology-these-images-stand-as-some-of-western-europes-most-important-achievements-of-late-fourteenth-century-painting">Andrea spent brief periods of the next ten years working in both Orvieto and Pisa. Upon his death in 1379, he left behind only a meager sum for his widow and child, suggesting that Andrea’s expenses largely outpaced his revenues. Despite the rather quiet end to his career, Andrea’s frescos on the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse document Dominican identity, preserve examples of their particular world view, and present their take on larger issues of Christian ideology. These images stand as some of western Europe’s most important achievements of late fourteenth-century painting.</h2>

      <h2>Andrea Pisano: ca. 1295 – 1348</h2>
      <p>As his surname suggests, Andrea Pisano came from the city of Pisa, located some 45 miles to the west of Florence on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. Although not directly descended from the father-son team of <a href="insert link">Nicola</a> and <a href="insert link">Giovanni Pisano</a>, Andrea’s contributions to the legacy of fourteenth-century art are no less important than those of his more famous predecessors.</p>

      <h2>Arnolfo di Cambio: </h2>
      <p>#Arnolfo di Cambio (ca. 1240 – 1302)
##Sculptor and Master Mason</p>

<p>Although Arnolfo di Cambio is best known for his architectural achievements in Florence, the Sienese sculptor and architect (c. 1240) began as a student and assistant to Nicola Pisano, who many consider the leading figure in the art of sculpture, just as <a href="insert link">Giotto</a> was an innovator in painting. During his time under Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo helped with the construction of the reliefs for the marble pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265) and those for the Tomb of San Dominic (1264-67). Arnolfo developed his classical style during this period and continued working in this idiom throughout his career.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Although he remained heavily influenced by Nicola Pisano in Siena, Arnolfo’s own style evolved after his move to Rome around 1277. While in the service of Charles of Anjou, Arnolfo revived the classical past in works such as the representation of the enthroned <em>French Duke</em> (c. 1280), which is thought to be one of the earliest portrait statues since ancient times, and the bronze statue of <em>St. Peter</em> for the Vatican (c. 1290), which is still venerated by pilgrims to this day. Arnolfo also carved the innovative <em>Monument to Cardinal De Braye</em> (1282) in the church of S. Domenico, Orvieto. By combining the classicist’s attention to volume and proportion with the elegance and intricacy of a Gothicizing artist, the sculptor created a theatrical scene that relates the death of the cardinal to his eternal salvation above. The style and construction that he used would influence wall tombs for over a century.</p>

<p>Arnolfo di Cambio’s two altar canopies in San Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1293) suggest his engagement with the Rayonnant Gothic style typically associated with the patronage of Louis IX of France. While both canopies demonstrate a keen eye towards form, proportion, and geometry, the employment of lacework, intricate patterns, and columns that taper toward the top suggest an awareness of the French artistic tradition. Other works that suggest Arnolfo’s responsiveness to this style include the Ciboria at St. Paul’s (1284), the <em>Annibaldi monument</em> in Saint John Lateran (c.1290), the Crib of Santa Maria Maggiore (1285-91), and the Chapel of St. Boniface (c. 1296).</p>

<p>Although he contributed greatly to the beautification of the city, Arnolfo di Cambio lived in Florence for only a short time. Originally brought in as a consultant for the construction of the cathedral of <a href="insert link">Santa Maria del Fiore</a> in 1296 (completed only in 1436 when <a href="insert link">Filippo Brunelleschi</a> finished the famous cupola over the building’s crossing), recent research suggests that the basic layout of <a href="insert link">Santa Croce</a> was also designed by Arnolfo in 1295, and <a href="insert link">Vasari</a> attributed to Arnolfo the designs for the <a href="insert link">Palazzo Vecchio</a> (initiated in 1298). His sculpted works can be seen in the façade of the Duomo, which include the <em>Nativity</em>, the <em>Dormition</em> (destroyed), and the <em>Madonna and Child</em> (1296), as well as the effigy of the <em>Enthroned Pope Boniface VIII</em> that harkens back to Arnolfo’s images of <em>St. Peter</em> and <em>Charles of Anjou</em> in Rome.</p>

<p>For his work in Florence, Arnolfo di Cambio would be honored by the Council of One Hundred in 1300, but the artist enjoyed this prestigious award only briefly: his activity was cut short by his untimely death in 1302.</p>

      <h2>Bernardo Daddi: ca. 1280 – 1348</h2>
      <p>A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280 – 1348) became one of Florence’s most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies.</p>

      <h2>Giottino: </h2>
      <p>#Giottino (ca. 1324-ca. 1365)
##Painter</p>

<p>Giottino, also known as Giotto di Stefano, was born around 1324 and lived in Florence until his death in the 1360’s, although the exact year of his death is unknown. His father, Maestro Stefano Florentino, was a famous Florentine painter who gained painterly prominence for his naturalistic style, earning him the nickname the “Scimmia della Natura” (“Ape of Nature”). Giottino likely received painting instruction from his father, but looked strongly towards the great <a href="insert link">Giotto</a> in the formation and development of his style. Much of Giottino’s written biographical history came from the writings of Vasari in his second writings titled <em>Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Giottino’s best known works include the 1356 <a href="insert link"><em>Madonna della Sagra</em></a>, a fresco painted in a small niche carved into the side of a building in a poor district in Florence. The working-class audience in that neighborhood had complete access to this fresco and, unlike his other paintings, could see this image daily. Giottino’s <a href="insert link"><em>Pietà</em></a>, painted for the Church of <a href="insert link">San Remigo</a> between 1360 and 1365, holds the crown as his best known individual work. The <em>Pietà</em> depicts a scene with twelve people surrounding the dead body of Christ, strewn across a small bedding with his feet on the left side of the image and his head on the right. Seven of the figures kneel around his dead body and offer prayers, while the other five remain standing and look towards Christ. A cross, centered and behind the figures, moves upward through the scene towards the top of the image and emanates to the left and right, adding balance and stillness to the image. Some of the figures in the image have been identified as the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalen, and other Saints, while also depicting two figures in modern attire who were likely the donors for the image. Giottino painted the <em>Pietà</em> in a highly naturalistic style, particularly for the 14th century. He appears to possess a rich understanding of the human body and how to portray it, and utilizes a naturalistic perspective and spacing between his figures. The gold background of <em>Pietà</em> underscores the scene’s holiness, while also serving to show the sanctity of the Church of San Remigo. The <em>Pietà</em> serves as an excellent example of Giottino’s great mastery of naturalism and perspective during his generation, strongly attributed to the influence of his father and Giotto.</p>

<h2 id="although-his-work-is-often-overlooked-due-to-the-strong-artistic-innovations-and-creations-during-the-renaissance-giottino-was-recognized-in-his-own-time-as-a-master-of-his-craft-giottino-was-not-able-to-live-a-full-life-as-he-died-in-his-late-thirties-or-early-forties-from-consumption-yet-still-made-an-impressive-mark-on-trecento-florentine-art">Although his work is often overlooked due to the strong artistic innovations and creations during the Renaissance, Giottino was recognized in his own time as a master of his craft. Giottino was not able to live a full life, as he died in his late thirties or early forties from consumption, yet still made an impressive mark on Trecento Florentine art.</h2>

      <h2>Giotto di Bondone: </h2>
      <p>#Giotto di Bondone (ca. 1265 – 1337)
##Painter and Architect</p>

<p>Few artists in the history of Western Civilization have received as much attention and adulation as Giotto di Bondone, a leading practitioner of a kind of pictorial representation that critics since the time of <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari</a> have credited with initiating a New Style of Art that we now associate with the period we call the “Renaissance.” Legends surrounding his genius cropped up during his lifetime, and the productivity of his large and active workshop – which extended from the university town of Padua in Northeast Italy all the way down to Naples in the southeast – both inspired generations of imitators and fooled the eyes of generations of critics that followed: as a result, the number of paintings ascribed to his hand is probably much larger than the actual number of images for which he was truly responsible.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>His origins, like those of most of his peers, can only be guessed at. Giotto appears to have been born in or around the year 1267, and he was certainly a contemporary of the famed poet, <a href="insert link">Dante Alighieri</a> (who mentions him by name in Purgatorio XI: 91-96), the Sienese master <a href="insert link">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>, and the painter <a href="insert link">Cimabue</a>, who <a href="insert link">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> and then Vasari claimed was his master. These two artists, Cimabue and Giotto, were linked together at the height of the latter’s career. As early as 1315, Dante celebrated them in a rather backwards way by using them as examples of the fleetingness of fame, when he famously wrote:</p>

<p>O, empty glory of the powers of humans!
	How briefly does green endure upon the peak –
	Unless an age of dullness follows it.
		In painting, Cimabue thought he held
	The field, but now it’s Giotto they acclaim –
	The former only keeps a shadowed fame.</p>

<p>The connection between Cimabue and Giotto was underscored in Ghiberti’s <em>Commentarii</em> of about 1450, in which the oft-repeated legend of the older artist’s discovery of the child prodigy – drawing a picture of a sheep on a rock – was first articulated. This initial comment on Giotto’s interest in using nature as a guide became the signature theme in Ghiberti’s biography of the painter. Wrote Ghiberti,</p>

<p>“Giotto was an enormously important figure in the field of painting. He brought forth to prominence the new art, abandoning the clumsiness of the Greeks. He made towering works of greatness, especially in the city of Florence (and in many other places) and collected disciples who were, in every way, the equal of the ancients. Indeed, one sees in Giotto’s art works that his followers could not better. He elevated nature in art, and with it a certain gentility, without ignoring proper proportions and measures. He was extremely skilled in all the arts, was an inventor and discoverer of many theories which had been buried for almost 600 years. When nature wanted to concede something, it conceded without a single complaint.”</p>

<p>Embedded in his lengthier biography of Giotto is Vasari’s terse remark that Giotto, “freed himself from the rude manner of the Greeks and brought back to life the true art of painting.”</p>

<p>These legends and tropes do little to secure for us an authentic understanding of Giotto’s origins and early works. Some have connected him to the motherhouse of the <a href="insert link">Franciscan Order</a> in Assisi and have argued that he was the sole creator of a series of frescoes (produced in the 1290s) in the upper basilica that illustrate scenes from the life of the thirteenth-century saint who started the order. Indeed, a document from the <a href="insert link">church of S. Francesco</a> ambiguously places him there sometime before 1310, although it is unclear whether Giotto was then actively painting in the upper basilica or in the lower one directly beneath it. While most Anglo-American scholars reject the attribution of the St. Francis cycle to Giotto, believing them instead to have been painted either the so-called <a href="insert link">St. Cecilia Master</a> or by Roman artists at the behest of the papacy (and Giotto’s work to have been confined to a single chapel in the lower basilica), the possibility of his activity in upper church of Assisi is still celebrated by Italian scholars – and by the friars who still live and work in the cloister there.</p>

<p>By 1300 he appears to have been in Rome, where Giotto is said to have produced for <a href="insert link">Pope Boniface VIII</a> a massive mosaic dedicated to the <em>Navicella</em> that graced the façade of Old St. Peter’s basilica until its destruction in the early sixteenth century. As is the case with Giotto’s other works from this early moment in his career, the Roman project is not documented.</p>

<p>The first time Giotto’s name appears in a written record comes in 1305, when the painter was mentioned working for Enrico Scrovegni in the Paduan chapel that bears the banker’s name. Responsible for both the architectural design of that private oratory and the frescoes painted within it, Giotto efficiently completed this project in roughly two years. The so-called Arena Chapel was dedicated on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1306, and the doors of the space were opened to the public annually on that date to commemorate his achievement. Among those who almost surely saw and marveled at the paintings Giotto produced there was the Florentine exile Dante Alighieri, by then a resident of Padua on the verge of penning one of the most influential works of literature in all of human history. Dante’s conception of Hell in the <a href="insert link">Inferno</a> (initiated around 1307) seems to rely quite heavily on the zones of the damned and the grouping of punishments that appear in the imagined cauldron of Giotto’s <em>Last Judgment</em> and the damaged souls inside it that the artist painted only a few months before Dante began writing his verses.</p>

<p>Giotto then made his way to Assisi, where he oversaw frescoes in the lower basilica of S. Francesco before finally making his way back to Florence – a city he had assiduously avoided for most of the duration of the quasi-civil war there that lasted for nearly all of the first decade of the fourteenth century. By 1312 he had finished an impressive crucifix for the <a href="insert link">Dominicans</a> at <a href="insert link">S. Maria Novella</a> that served as a model for younger artists producing similar paintings for the remainder of the Trecento. In 1317, he began a lengthy project to fresco the walls of the <a href="insert link">Bardi Chapel</a> along the right transept of the Franciscan church of <a href="insert link">S. Croce</a>, with scenes from the life of <a href="insert link">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Just before leaving for Naples in 1328, where Giotto worked for five years as the court artist of Robert of Anjou, his workshop completed frescoes that illustrated the miracles of St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Baptist in the <a href="insert link">Peruzzi Chapel</a>, adjacent to the aforementioned Bardi Chapel. The altarpiece of the <em>Coronation of the Virgin</em> was probably completed at roughly the same time, that is sometime around 1328, and has much in common with the hotly contested double-sided altarpiece that Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi commissioned from Giotto and placed in the canon’s choir of Old St. Peter’s basilica in Rome either in 1300 or in 1329. Take your pick.</p>

<p>Giotto’s work in Naples comes down to us only in the form of notices and vague archival references. The elderly artist, then in his sixties, may have painted some works for the Angevin king there, but whatever he completed was ruined by a series of earthquakes that had, by the end of the eighteenth century, utterly leveled almost the entire medieval city (and most of the artistic works that once shined inside it).</p>

<p>By 1333 Giotto was back in Florence, now feted as the official City Artist despite his advanced age. Indeed, the artist seems to have received his appointment from the city at precisely the moment of his retirement. Giotto managed to set down designs for the <a href="insert link">Campanile</a> that stands next to the cathedral’s façade, but those designs were so poorly executed that the project was halted and re-configured out of fear that Giotto’s building would completely collapse. Other than the Campanile project, Giotto pursued practically no other commissions during this final stage of his career, and it may well be that his post a City Artist was actually an administrative post (or, just as likely, merely an honorific title), and that his real job was to delegate (or even sub-contract) important commissions to younger artists like <a href="insert link">Bernardo Daddi</a> and <a href="insert link">Andrea Pisano</a>.</p>

<p>Yet Giotto’s legacy cannot be exaggerated. His approach to naturalistic figures and believable narratives catapulted Florentine art from the stodgy and predictable effigies painted by thirteenth-century artisans, deeply wedded to elongated and stylized Byzantine traditions, to a vibrant and animated visual environment that valued energy, emotional content, and gestural drama. His conveyance of mystical sublimity in <em>The Stigmatization of St. Francis</em> at the top of the Bardi Chapel, for example, succeeds due to the recognizable anatomical form that emerges from underneath Francis’ garment and the unrelenting facial expression of the elderly friar confronting his God. The emotionally fraught image of Francis’s followers who mourn his death in the <em>Burial of St. Francis</em> inside the chapel counters this image by placing around the dead saint a collection of tormented men, each one lost in his own psychological state of grief and each one contributing to the broader emotional environment created by this Greek Chorus of unified anguish, all of which has been depicted through the furrowed brows and downturned lips and thrusting hands of otherwise anonymous clerics. No one had ever seen paintings quite like this before, and their impact was immediate and pervasive, as evidenced by the legion of imitators who strove to echo his new approach to pictorial naturalism.</p>

<p>Giotto’s innovative spirit captured the imagination of writers during and after his lifetime. <a href="insert link">Boccaccio</a> famously cast Giotto in a number of his tales in the <a href="insert link"><em>Decameron</em></a> from ca. 1351, making the painter out to be a sage judge of character. <a href="insert link">Francesco Sacchetti’s</a> <a href="insert link"><em>Trecento Novelle</em></a> from the 1390s expanded on this literary trope by ascribing to Giotto a certain wit and wisdom that put the craftsman on par with Florence’s greatest minds. And Vasari’s sixteenth-century story of “Giotto’s O,” a play on Pliny the Elder’s tales (concerning the Greek painters Apelles, Parahaxios, and Protogenes) in which the artist drew a perfect circle – free hand – before an uncomprehending papal lackey, came to be seen by modern painters (like Rembrandt van Rijn) as the perfect allegory of artistic dexterity. To this day, Giotto receives a kind of adulation among Italian art lovers as a groundbreaker among groundbreakers, the first of the painterly Evangelists who, along with <a href="insert link">Masaccio</a>, <a href="insert link">Leonardo</a>, and <a href="insert link">Michelangelo</a>, proselytized a new approach to the visual arts.</p>

<p>Importantly, some of Giotto’s stylistic and intellectual innovations were disseminated even before his death. His talented workshop almost certainly included <a href="insert link">Taddeo Gaddi</a> and <a href="insert link">Maso di Banco</a>, two of the most gifted painters of the fourteenth century who gained their independence and produced important works of their own as soon as Giotto left for Naples in 1328. In fact, many of the figures and scenes credited to Giotto’s hand in the 1310s and ‘20s were, in all probability, actually executed by these great masters-in-training, thanks to the tradition of workshop production that dictated a delegation of productivity among assistants on the scaffold. But even painters who did train directly with Giotto looked to his art for inspiration. <a href="insert link">Pacino di Buonaguida</a> and Bernardo Daddi, excellent painters in their own right, quoted the details of Giotto’s passages with frequency and skill, even though they appear to have come from different pictorial traditions. Even after the passing of the <a href="insert link">Black Death</a> in 1348 – that watershed event that, at least chronologically (if not psychologically), divides the late Middle Ages from the early Modern period – Giotto’s compositions, figures, gestures, and narrative solutions still held sway among painters like <a href="insert link">Andrea Orcagna</a> and <a href="insert link">Nardo di Cione</a>, <a href="insert link">Niccolò di Pietro Gerini</a>, and even <a href="insert link">Lorenzo Monaco</a> into the fifteenth century. Only with the advent of Masaccio, the first painter of the Quattrocento to truly understand Giotto and his approach to naturalistic representation, did artists begin to build upon the traditions he had founded in the early Trecento.</p>

      <h2>Maso di Banco: </h2>
      <p>#Maso di Banco (ca. 1305 – ca. 1350)
##Painter</p>

<p>Though he only worked for a short period in the first half of the 14th century, Maso di Banco is considered one of the greatest students of <a href="insert link">Giotto</a>. Despite his illustrious teacher and accomplished personal career, almost no information remains about his life. Though it is known that he worked in Florence circa 1330-1350, none of his work was ever signed or dated, a fact which has furthered the mystery surrounding his brief career.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The frescoes of the <a href="insert link">Bardi di Vernio Chapel</a> in the Franciscan friary of <a href="insert link">S. Croce</a> are the only works attributed to him without question, a tradition informed by <a href="insert link">Ghiberti’s</a> early writings that describe Maso’s impressive skill as both a painter and sculptor, and attribute the frescoes of the chapel to him. The frescoes primarily depict scenes from the Life of St. Sylvester, but also include images of the <em>Resurrection of Christ</em> and the <em>Last Judgment</em>. The Life of St. Sylvester includes the prominent image of <a href="insert link"><em>St. Sylvester and the Dragon</em></a> on the south wall, a dramatic scene which exemplifies his clear style and illustrates the direct influence of Giotto. Both painters used a similar palette of pinks, greys, reds, and whites, as well as light and dark contrasts to convey a sense of naturalism. The legacy of Giotto can also be seen in Maso’s figures, which share the same individuality of expression. Credited with being more restrained and simpler that Giotto, Maso’s scenes dilute drama in favor of illusionistic depictions of deep space and connections to surrounding architecture. In creating these deep spaces, Maso places his figures in a way that helps suggest a certain kind of three dimensionality.</p>

<p>These stylistic tendencies reappear in the fresco on the opposite wall of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel. In the image of the <em>Resurrection</em> on the north wall, Maso placed the painted figure of the Resurrected Christ rising up over a sculpted tomb, making it seem as though the event happens before our eyes. This blending of art and its setting allows for a consistent narrative, further fueling the story and the importance of its characters, which in turn enhances the holiness of the space.</p>

<p>The little information we have about Maso includes the mention of him in guild records and registers, such as his matriculation into the <a href="insert link">Arte de’ Medici e Speziali guild</a> in 1346 and the appearance of his name in the Register of the <a href="insert link">Compagnia di S. Luca</a> in 1350. But there is no mention of him at any time after this. Given this lack of documentation, Maso di Banco’s legacy relies chiefly on Ghiberti’s accounts of his skill and range, his status as a pupil of Giotto, and most importantly his frescoes in the Bardi di Vernio Chapel.</p>

      <h2>Taddeo Gaddi: </h2>
      <p>#Taddeo Gaddi (ca. 1290-1366)
##Painter</p>

<p>Taddeo Gaddi, born circa 1290, is often described as one of the most talented artists and builders living in Florence during the medieval era. Heralded as one of <a href="insert link">Giotto’s</a> most able pupils, Gaddi exuded a reverence for his master’s stylistic technique and sought to follow the artistic method of his teacher. Sometimes this resulted in a kind of imitative quality that caused <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari </a> to comment harshly on Gaddi’s aping of Giotto’s aesthetic, stating “(Gaddi) always continued Giotto’s manner without improving it,”  a backwards compliment that suggests a slavish imitation on the part of Taddeo Gaddi.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Despite working in the shadow of his famous master, Gaddi enjoyed a successful career in art, opening his own shop and receiving some of the most lucrative commissions in all of Florence. One such commission came from the Franciscan friary in the city, where Taddeo Gaddi was assigned as chief decorator for the group’s main worship center, the Basilica of <a href="insert link">Santa Croce</a>. This ornate building contains important works by Gaddi, including his frescoes of the <em>Tree of Life</em> on the west wall of the conventual <a href="insert link">Refectory</a>, quatrefoil panels of the Life of Francis that ornamented a large cabinet, and murals for the <a href="insert link">Cappella Baroncelli (1328-1330)</a>. Annunciation and visitation scenes align the altar walls of this latter space, and the large murals present themselves to viewers in grand fashion. Iconographically, these paintings are unmistakably evocative of Giotto’s work in the Arena Chapel at Padua (ca. 1305) and this imitation showcases Gaddi’s ceaseless reliance on his teacher as a fountain for inspiration. Despite Vasari’s critique, Gaddi did not merely imitate Giotto’s style, but managed to advance his master’s groundbreaking achievements: his ability to utilize natural light and rich hues to achieve perfect representations of color, seen in the Baroncelli <em>Adoration of the Magi</em>, displays Gaddi’s mastery of the color wheel that surpasses even that of Giotto’s.</p>

<h2 id="until-his-death-in-1366-taddeo-gaddi-was-one-of-the-most-influential-men-in-florentine-artistic-culture-despite-being-viewed-as-a-simple-follower-of-giotto-taddeo-triumphantly-surpassed-his-liege-in-the-methodology-of-colors-and-light-his-work-in-the-basilica-santa-croce-provides-a-canonical-viewing-of-gaddis-copycat-style-while-also-underscoring-his-heightened-proficiency-with-color">Until his death in 1366 Taddeo Gaddi was one of the most influential men in Florentine artistic culture. Despite being viewed as a simple follower of Giotto, Taddeo triumphantly surpassed his liege in the methodology of colors and light. His work in the Basilica Santa Croce provides a canonical viewing of Gaddi’s copycat style while also underscoring his heightened proficiency with color.</h2>

In 1322 members of the <a href="insert link">Arte della Calimala</a>, the Cloth Merchants Guild that was responsible for the building’s maintenance, upkeep, and decorations, moved to cover those doors with metal plates that they felt would act as a sign of the structure’s importance.

A massive structure, carved in marble with sections of inlaid gold and mosaic tesserae sprinkled throughout, the tabernacle both framed the picture that, in 1365, was named the “official painting of Florence” and stood on its own as a cultural curiosity that brought in local and international viewers in droves (figure 1).</p>

#Information on the Statues
The information given here is derived from the information cards found in the Museum of Orsanmichele. Translations doen by Aidan Valente.

##Saint Peter
- c. 1425
- Attributed to Bernardo Ciuffagni
- Arte dei Beccai
In the absence of documentary sources, for the statue of Saint Peter both dating and artistic paternity have always been strongly controversial. It has been traditionally attributed to Donatello due to the words written by Vasari; in fact, he asserted that the Arte dei Beccai had assigned the execution of the work to Brunelleschi and Donatello together, but that the latter had worked alone.
For the sculpture, "most wise and wonderful," also attributed in the past to Nanni di Banco and to Michelozzo, there was recently advanced a new hypothesis, that sees Filippo Brunelleschi as the author of both the tabernacle and of the statue, in which the artist would propose a model of antique statuary in a time in which his interest in sculpture is documented, shared with Donatello.
Less suggested, but perhaps more convincing appears the just-as-recent attribution that revives the name, once advanced in the past, of Bernardo Ciuffagni, postponing the dating to the middle of the second decade of the Quattrocento.
The Saint Peter turned out to be one of the marble statues in the best condition of conservation, perhaps because it is carved from a special quality and compact apuane marble, was removed from its tabernacle in 1990 and restored by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure the following year. It is the only statue on which traces of gilding were not found, not only from degradation, so that it is supposed to have had none from the outset. The poor porosity of the marble has preserved the work not only from degradation, but also from absorbing the oils laid on all of the marbles between the end of the Settecento and the Ottocento, to match them to the bronzes.
For the restoration and execution of the copy placed in the tabernacle at the occasion of the Museum's opening, the Academia of Florence and the Association of Butchers participated as sponsors in honor of their ancient art.

##Incredulity of Saint Thomas
- 1473-1483
- Andrea del Verrocchio
- Tribunale di Mercatanzia
The Tribune of Merchandise had acquired, in 1463, the niche of the Guelf Party that, years before (previous to the year 1452), had removed the bronze and gilded statue of Saint Louis by Donatello. The work was commissioned to Verrocchio in 1466, when the artist was just tired, and was completed in 1483. In 1468 it was already established that the statues were two, and the innovative idea of placing Christ and St. Thomas in the tabernacle, not statically isolated, but dialogue among themselves in an almost theatrical simulation of an affective and psychological encounter, it was already entirely elaborated between 1473 and 1476 when the figure of Christ was finished.
The accurate restoration of the group, removed from the tabernacle in 1988, was concluded by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in 1992, and has highlighted the excellence of executive technique: the two figures are in fact made of bronze, with the "lost wax" technique on the back like bas-reliefs, and for each one it used a unique metal alloy casting. In order to prevent the possibility of an albeit minimum defect, very high metal thicknesses were made and the surface, after the smelting, was finished, polished, and chiselled with extraordinary care.
The work was created in plaster at the laboratories of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, while the casting of the copy was recently executed under the care of the Superintendence for Environmental and Architectural Heritage.

##Saint John the Baptist
- 1413-1416
- Lorenzo Ghiberti
- Arte di Calimala
The statue of Saint John the Baptist was realized by Ghiberti under the commission of the Arte di Calimala from 1413 to 1416, while he was engaged on the North Doors of the Baptistery, and was the first grand work cast in bronze in Florence with the "lost wax" method. The same artist noted in his diary his preoccupation with the enterprise: "I did not cast it at my own expense; if it did not go well, I would have to lose the expense."
The recent restoration has brought some defects to light, attributable to an incorrect evaluation of the weight that, producing a shift in the center of gravity, impedes the statue from standing on its feet alone.
The work is signed "OPUS LAUR[E]NTII" on the hem of the garment, in which the cleaning has revealed traces of gilding.
Ghiberti prefered to represent the prophet as an adult, according to the typological Eastern iconography in vogue at the end of the Trecento, rather than the youth as found in the Renaissance. The critical reception of this Ghibertian sculpture was very low, judged very severly by critics, and considered the artist's least successful work until the thirties of this century. It was disliked for the languor of the figure and the lack of harmony between the realistic and Eastern elements. A reexamination of the work, considered within the artistic evolution of Ghiberti and no longer in relation to contemporary Florentine sculpture, has finally started, in recent times, the most deserving of reeavluations: the Saint John the Baptist may be today safely considered a masterpiece of Late Gothic Florentine statuary.
The sculpture, conceived for the contemporary tabernacle of the Arte di Calimala, also designed by Ghiberti, but executed by Albizo di Piero, was removed from its original seat in 1992; the Opificio delle Pietre Dure completed its restoration in 1994.
Making the mold remains a project, for the copy for the tabernacle and that in gesso for the Gipsoteca dell'Istituto Statale d'Arte di Firenze.

##Saint John the Evangelist
- 1515
- Baccio da Montelupo
- Arte della Seta
The historical sources relay that the Arte dei Setaiolo, wanting to substitute the marble statue of their tabernacle, commissioned the statue of their patron from the sculptor Baccio da Montelupo in 1515 and that the work cost 340 gold florins.
Vasari, recording that there were many competitors for this ambitious enterprise, wrote: "This work was finished by him with total diligence. It is said that when he had done the figure in clay, those who saw the order of the armature and the shapes he had on it, he had a beautiful thing, considering Baccio's great genius in that. And those who saw it cast with such ease, gave to Baccio the title to have a great deal of mastery, made a nice cast. These hard times in that profesion, a good name, gave him; and today more than ever by all the artists kept this figure beautiful."
It was rightly noted by critics how this sculpture is certainly an homage to the arte of Donatello and in particular to the Saint Mark of Orsanmichele, to which it allusively recalls the weathered pride of the face, made vibrant by the flowing beard, and the plastic yield of the ample folds of the mantle.
The work embodies in full the sculptor in that group of intellectuals inspired by Savonarola, who considered the link with the traditional Florentine humanism fundamental to rediscover the essence of moral, spiritual, and even artistic activity.
The Saint John the Evangelist, still in its tabernacle, is awaiting restoration.

##Madonna della Rosa
- c. 1400
- Anonymous
- Arte dei Medici e Speziali
The statue, representing a Madonna enthroned with the Infant Jesus, but called the Madonna of the Rose for the bunch of dog roses that the Infant Jesus seeks to grab from the hands of the Mother, is not documented and is therefore the object of numerous critical hypotheses culminating with the attribution to Piero di Giovanni Tedesco, a late Gothic sculptor from the north, active at the construction site of the Opera del Duomo.
The work, of which analogies with neo-Giottesque painting have been noted, for the search for equilibrium and composure that distingues it, is noted for the highly documented episode of defacement, which cost the life of the "marrano" who may have been guilty and which is recording in the Latin inscription at the base, which recounts the date (1493).
The state of conservation, visibly better compared to those found in the other marble statues of Orsanmichele, is due to the fact that the work was shifted in 1628 to the interior of the church, and then returned to the exterior in 1925. Three hundred years of shelter have preserved the statue from degrading, saving it also from the bronzed tone, which is irreversibly left, though more or less accentuated, on the surfaces of the other marble statues, the object of bronze color coatings in the Sette- and Ottocento.
The statue was recently cleaned under the care of the Superintendence for Environmental and Architectural Heritage of Florence, revealing an intact surface, even if scratched from an old, drastic cleaning. There are no remaining traces of gilding, except those on the bunch of roses.
Like the other sculptures, the Madonna of the Rose will be molded as soon as possible to obtain a copy to be placed in the tabernacle of the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, of which it was the patron, and that in gesso to be placed in the Gipsoteca dell'Istituito Statale d'Arte di Firenze.

##Saint James
- c. 1422
- Attributed to Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti
- Arte dei Valai e Pellicciai
The marble statue, commissioned by the Arte dei Vaiai e Pelliccia of which Saint James was the patron, was, like the tabernacle that contained it, at the center of a complex critical-attributive event determined also by the lack of sources documenting its execution. If the attribution to the Florentine sculptor Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti seems now agreed upon, on its dating the positions are less equivical, and if, at the base of various theses, the stylistic relationship between the statue remains, still intensely Gothic in elongated proportions and for the absence of volumetric and spatial recession, and the works of Ghiberti, in particular, the Saint John the Baptist and the Saint Matthew.
The statue of Saint James, to which in 1858 there were repairs to some fingers of the right hand, was removed from its tabernacle in 1986, and restored at the Opifico delle Pietre Dure in the following years: also its marble appears obscured by the treatment received between the Sette- and the Ottocento to render it similar to bronze and also, after cleaning, it has revealed traces of gilding on the hair and on the ornaments of the dress.
The mold and the copy, recently settled in the tabernacle, were executed under the care of tthe Superintendence for Environmental and Architectural Heritage in 1995, while the copy in gesso will be soon handled by the Istituto Statale d'Arte, which will conserve it in the Gipsoteca.
Remaining for now in its place, the relief, of admirable Gothic elegance, located at the base of the tabernacle and represents the Martyrdom of Saint James.

##Saint Mark
- 1411-1413
- Donatello
- Arte dei Linaioli e Rigattieri
The marble statue of Saint Mark, patron of the Arte dei Linaioli, was placed in the niche assigned to it, on the southern facade of Orsanmichele, in the year 1413. From documents we know that, four years previously, the Arte had commissioned to the sculptor Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti a block of Apuan marble for the monumental sculpture. In 1411 the sculpture's assignment was entrusted to Donatello, committing him to hand it over "gilded and fitted with every appropriate ornament," before the first of November, 1412. In the meantime, the Prefects Giovanni and Albizzo di Pietro had been appointed to realize the not entirely finished tabernacle, like the statue, in April of 1413.
The Saint Mark, always admired for its formal values and for the great force with which it expresses gravity and moral committment, was, like the other marble statues exposed in the external niches of Orsanmichele, subjected to one or more bronze-colored patinas applied before the last decade of the eighteenth century, and was removed from its seat on the occasion of the second World War. Once again separated from its tabernacle in 1977, it was restored under the care of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence, in which laboratory, thanks to a sponsorship by the Rhone Poulenc and the care of Michel Bourbon, was realized the copy relocated in the niche, as well as a copy in gesso deposited in the Istituto Statale d'Arte di Firenze.
The accurate restoration, rediscovering the fluidity of the model and the traces of gilding (on the hair, beard, book, pillow, and hem of the robe) has brought to light how much of the Gothic remains in this sculpture, which modern criticism regarded instead as the first totally Renaissance work in the artistic course of grand Florentine sculpture.

##Saint Eligius
- c. 1417-1421
- Nanni di Banco
- Arte dei Maniscalchi
The statue was commissioned by the Arte dei Maniscalchi, of which Saint Eligius was the patron, together with the Orafi, who were associated for the occasion. The work is not documented like the Four Crowned Saints and Saint Phillip, and also, less than the others, cited by historical sources. However, criticism did not question the attribution to Nanni di Banco, already present in the Anonymous Magliabechiano and taken from Vasari. Like the aforementioned works, there remains a great deal of discussion about the dating, and still controversial is the chronological sequence of its execution. The strong Gothicism of the figure and, on the other hand, the less-stressed classicism, are understood by critics as a starting point or a sign of evolution, that would be explained by the influence of Ghiberti's style and, in particular, the figure of Saint John the Baptist executed for Orsanmichele. More recent studies, in noting some unfinished details and a disharmonic assembly of the statue and of the other reliefs of the niche, hypothesize that the whole thing was mounted directly after the death of Nanni di Banco and therefore support the thesis that the Saint Eligius is an extreme work in the life of the sculptor.
The statue, whose pastorale in the past was stolen several times until the decision to leave it without, was removed from the tabernacle in 1988 and restored by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, which rediscovered traces of gilding in the hair and on the ornaments of the clothes where there remain fragments of ultramarine. Because there existed a copy in gesso in the Gipsoteca of the Istituto Statale d'Arte of Florence, they were able to avoid using the statue to obtain the stone copy. The new copy, made from the gesso, was placed in the tabernacle of the Maniscalchi on the occasion of the opening of the Museum.

##Saint Stephen
- 1427-1428
- Lorenzo Ghiberti
- Arte della Lana
The statue of Saint Stephen was the fourth statue in bronze cast for Orsanmichele, and was commissioned by the Arte dei Lanaioli, which in 1425 had decided on the substitution for a marble statue of the same subject, precociously (1340) placed in the tabernacle assigned to it. The work, for which in 1427 the Arte had allocated the money corresponding to four pounds of bronze, was already in the tabernacle the following year. Ghiberti likewise, in the second of his Commentaries, records the undertaking: "I undertook for the governors of the Arte della Lana a statue of bronze four and a half braccia high, standing in the oratory of the Orto Santo Michele, of which the statue is Saint Stephen martyr, which, being my second work, was made with great diligence."
The Saint Stephen has not enjoyed critical success starting with Vasari, who praised only the verdigris of the bronze: it has never benefitted from the comparison with Saint Matthew, compared to which the sculpture appeared to many to have less artistic qualities, less avant-garde, and somewhat manicured with its impeccable drapery responding to the Gothic canon. But more modern criticism has emphasized the attention paid by the sculptor, in one view certainly Renaissance in volumetrics, in the proportions of the sculpture, and in the classicism of the face, for which it is even hypothesized an archetype shared with the Saint Phillip by Nanni di Banco.
The statue is still in its tabernacle awaiting restoration.

##Saint Matthew
- 1419-1422
- Lorenzo Ghiberti
- Arte del Cambio
The Arte del Cambio wanted, with this bronze statue, to rival the Arte di Calimala, which had previously commissioned from Ghiberti the Saint John the Baptist. The events of the deal and of the realization of the work are documented minutely, from the election of the committee for the construction of the tabernacle in 1419 (one of the members was Cosimo the Elder), to the resgistration, in March of 1423, of the expense sums, among which appear the 650 florins for the sculptor.
We know that the head and the body of the statue, modelled in 1420, were cast separately in bronze and then united, and it is also noted that Ghiberti failed the first fusion, followed in 1421, and he had to redo it at his own expense the following year.
The bronze, finely chiseled in the curls of the hair and of the beard, bears, on the lower border of the mantle, which conserves traces of gilding, the following inscription: "OPUS UNIVEERSITATIS CANSORUM FLORENTIA ANNO MCCCCXXii." To Ghiberti was also commissioned the niche, which was in the course of construction when the statue was finished.
A documented, late, and limited collaboration by Michelozzo has been amplified and subject to some critical fortune, then correctly resized. He was amazed by the strong and un-classical episode by which the work is permeated. Despite the undoubted stylistic references, in the realism of some particulars, with the Saint John the Baptist and with the final reliefs of the North Baptistery Doors, the sculpture appears quite antithetical to the spirit of the International Gothic, placing in relation Ghiberti with the humanistic Florentine world.
The bronze, which perhaps has suffered more than the others, for being placed in one of the two less profound niches of Orsanmichele because of their correspondence with the pillar inside which is the scale that connects the church with the upper floors, is still in the tabernacle awaiting restoration.

##Saint George
- 1415-1417
- Donatello
- Arte dei Corazzai e Spadai
The statue of Saint George, placed in a tabernacle less profound for the coincedence with the inside stair inserted in the corner pilaster, was commissioned by the Arte dei Corazzai e Spadai, and the bellicose saint was coneceived by Donatello in the act of looking fiercely in the direction, north-east, where reside Florence's traditional enemies.
Vasari caught the exceptionality of the sculpted figure that he defined: "...lively, in the head of that which one recognizes the beauty in the youth, the soul, and the valor of the weapons, a vivacity fiercely terrible, and a marvelous gesture of movement in that rock." The merited fame of the work also extends to the admirable form that Donatello inserted, after 1417, at the base of the tabernacle, representing Saint George killing the dragon, noteworthy for the schiacciato relief and for the perspective intuition, that are at the base of the admirable fusion of the figures with a space that appears profound and seamless.
The great admiration, of which was always the object of the Saint George of Donatello, has made sure that special attention has been paid to it by those responsible for its conservation. The degradation that struck it in a particular due to the low depth of the niche and the northward exposure, forced it in the nineteenth centuriy to a series a shifts between his tabernacle and that, left empty by the Madonna della Rosa, of the Medici e Speziali, more pretected and better oriented. The early museumization of the statue, whose nose was also broken in 1858 with a thrown rock, dates to 1891, when it was definitvely moved into the Museo Nazionale del Bargello where one still finds it with the predella, recovered in 1976. In place of the Donatellian marble was placed, not without criticism, a bronze copy executed by Oronzio Lelli and the Fonderia Galli in 1892. The copy, cleaned some years ago, is still in place.
We do not know if it will ever be possible to fill the space created for the Saint George in preparation of the Museum. While taking into account the museumization of the Bargello and by now more than historicized, it seems to us that, in this case, there would be no valid historical and scientific reasons for bringing the work to the monument for which it was conceived, accompanied by all the other sculptures of Orsanmichele.

##The Four Crowned Martyrs
- c. 1409-1416/1417
- Nanni di Banco
- Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e di Legname
A unique group with four figures in the tabernacles of Orsanmichele, represents four martyrs killed by Diocletian and elected as patrons of the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e di Legname, who were in part both architects and sculptors. According to a legend, infact, Castore, Claudio, Sinfoniano, and Nicostrato were most able artists, who had refused to execute a statue of Aesclepius for the emperor.
On this group, as with the Saint Phillip and the Saint Eligius, there are not received documents, but the sources are in concord in attributing the work to Nanni di Banco. Very controversial is instead the date of execution, as is the chronological succession of the three works by Nanni di Banco at Orsanmichele, to the point that, in relation to the more or less earliest date hypothesized by critics, the undoubted classicity of the sculptural group was explained as a goal (from late-Gothic to Renaissance language) or instead as another Trecentesque departure towards a successive, refined Gothicism. The most recent studies, on the basis of unedited documents, place the statue in the period found between 1409 and c. 1416/17.
The work, pervaded by a strong spirit of Antiquity by the solemn poses and composures and for the very placement of the figures in a semicircle, probably borrowed from an Antique example, was sculpted using three blocks of marble: the two figures to the left are in fact linked by many blocks of marble, while those on the right are both obtained from a single block.
The Four Holy Saints, the last sculptures in marble still unrestored, will be taken shortly from the tabernacle and brought to the laboratories of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure.

##Saint Phillip
- c. 1410-1412
- Nanni di Banco
- Arte dei Calzolai
In absence of documents on the commission of the work, the historical sources are in agreement on the attribution to Nanni di Banco of the statue of Saint Phillip the Apostle, patron of the Arte dei Calzolai, but critics are not likewise in agreement on the dating, always closely connected with that of the other works by the artist present at Orsanmichele: the Four Holy Martyrs and the Saint Eligius. The two works, by their figurative language, more classic in the first and therefore closer to that of San Filippo, and more Gothic in the second, were alternatively considered as points of departure or arrival in the artistic evolution of the sculptor. Only recently, on the basis of stylistic considerations, a more precise dating of the single statues that comprise the Four Holy Martyrs, has permitted the placement of the execution of the Saint Phillip between that of the youngest  and that of the oldest of the four Saints, allowing to date it with a certain reliability to the years 1410-1412.
The sculpture, which may be considered one of the most academical works by Nanni di Banco, was retired from its tabernacle in 1992, and was restored in the laboratories of the Opifico delle Pietre Dure: also on its surface, along the pleated border of the the vestment and the shoes, there were found evident traces of gilding. The Superintendence for Environmental and Architectural Heritage is currently executing the copy, for which the impression has already been taken.

##Saint Luke
- 1583-1601
- Giambologna
- Arte dei Giudici e Notai
The events relative to the statue of Saint Luke, which is signed and dated "IOA. BOL. BELG. MDCII," are well described in a series of documents, of which some were found and published very recently.
The statue substituted the marble Saint Luke, actually exposed in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, executed before 1406 by Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti, also author of the tabernacle. The Arte dei Giudici e Notai had initially charged the sculptor Stoldo di Gino Lorenzi of Settignano who, before dying in 1583, had only time to procure the marble. His death determined the commission to the famous sculptor and the decision to erect the statue in bronze, as it was like those of Ghiberti and of Verocchio posted in the same facade on the Via Calzaioli. From the date of Giambologna's charge, in 1583, to the date of finalization, in 1602, almost twenty years passed during which the sculptor, depsite the pressures of the Arte, had to give precedence to numerous Granducal commissions. In any case, it is certain that, in 1590, there already existed in Giambologna's workshop the life-size terracotta model, which would have served for the casting, and likewise certain to appear that the setting of the sculpture, even if updated at the moment of the effective realization, presents figurative solutions of accented Mannerism. which are well framed in the artistic production of the 1580s, moreso than in that seicentesque of Giambologna.
The Saint Lukehas suffered an unmerited critical misfortune, despite the fact that Bernini himself lauded it greatly. It has damaged it to be wrongly considered a late work produced by the artist in old age, and it has resonated with the marble statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle of the Cathedral of Orvieto, allocated to Giambologna in 1595, performed by Francavilla in 1600 and for this believed antecedent to Saint Luke, while instead the documents authorize us to assert that the ideation of this last and the terracotta sketch, which then served Francvilla, preceded the Orvietan commission.
The statue is still in the niche on the outside of Orsanmichele, awaiting restoration.
