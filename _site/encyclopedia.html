      <h2 id="baptism-in-florence">Baptism in Florence</h2>

<p>The ritual of baptism was a crucial feature of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Florence. This symbolic practice carried both a spiritual and social weight integral for full participation in the fabric of Florentine society. Baptism was not only a means of defense against hellfire, but an introduction to civic society and a foundational moment in each individual’s life. While some of the finer details of the practice are unclear to contemporary scholars, we now know that by 1128 the ritual was performed at the octagonal Baptistery of San Giovanni, located directly across from the cathedral.</p>

      <h2>Andrea di Bonaiuto: </h2>
      <p>#Andrea di Bonaiuto (ca. 1325-1379)
##Painter</p>

<p>Born around 1325, the painter Andrea di Bonaiuto survived the bubonic plague which swept through Florence in 1348 and worked in Pisa and Florence until his death in 1379. Relatively few archival records of his life remain, and he signed and dated virtually none of his works. However, his most significant achievement, the fresco cycle in the chapterhouse of Santa Maria Novella (for which documents do survive), serves as one of the great artistic triumphs of the <em>Trecento</em>, and provides important insights into Florentine religious life.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Andrea entered the Florentine <a href="insert link">Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries</a> in 1346 and, beginning in 1351, lived in the quarter of Santa Maria Novella that was named for the great basilica of the Dominican Order. His work bears resemblance to that of <a href="insert link">Nardo di Cione (ca. 1320-1365)</a>, another Florentine artist with whom he may have apprenticed. Andrea left Florence in 1355 to work in Pisa for roughly ten years. When he returned in 1365, he received the commission to decorate the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse, now known as the <a href="insert link">Spanish Chapel</a>. In return for his work, <a href="insert link">Zanobi Guasconi</a>, the prior of Santa Maria Novella at the time, granted Andrea and his wife a house valued at sixty-five florins (the modern equivalent of roughly $130,000). Andrea’s contract stated that he complete the project within a period of two years, beginning on January 1, 1366, and he appears to have honored this stipulation.</p>

<p>The Dominican chapterhouse served as one of the focal points of daily Dominican life and ritual. Many liturgical and ceremonial functions took place there, as well as the day-to-day administration of the chapter. Upon the arrivals of prominent visitors, the Dominicans would have guided their guests first to the chapterhouse, the center of their organization. Thus, the pictures that decorated the chapterhouse would have been seen by the Dominicans on a daily basis and would represent their chapter to visitors.</p>

<p>Although one of the Dominicans probably devised the mural cycle’s sophisticated program, their decision to commission Andrea for the chapterhouse decorations demonstrates their esteem for him and his work. Scenes from the <em>Passion of Christ</em> make up the cycle’s central image, with images of the <em>Way to Calvary</em>, the <em>Crucifixion</em>, and the <em>Harrowing of Hell</em> covering the north wall of the chapel. Other images such as the <a href="insert link"><em>Via Veritatis</em></a> depict Saints Dominic, Peter Martyr, and Thomas Aquinas celebrating the intellectual and spiritual triumphs of the Order. In the same year he received the chapterhouse commission, civic leaders in Florence appointed Andrea to a <a href="insert link">committee</a> tasked with designing the dome for Florence’s cathedral. He served as a committee member for two years until 1367, and the representation of the domed cathedral in the <em>Via Veritatis</em> surely reflects his own conception of how that cupola ought to have looked.</p>

<h2 id="andrea-spent-brief-periods-of-the-next-ten-years-working-in-both-orvieto-and-pisa-upon-his-death-in-1379-he-left-behind-only-a-meager-sum-for-his-widow-and-child-suggesting-that-andreas-expenses-largely-outpaced-his-revenues-despite-the-rather-quiet-end-to-his-career-andreas-frescos-on-the-walls-of-santa-maria-novellas-chapterhouse-document-dominican-identity-preserve-examples-of-their-particular-world-view-and-present-their-take-on-larger-issues-of-christian-ideology-these-images-stand-as-some-of-western-europes-most-important-achievements-of-late-fourteenth-century-painting">Andrea spent brief periods of the next ten years working in both Orvieto and Pisa. Upon his death in 1379, he left behind only a meager sum for his widow and child, suggesting that Andrea’s expenses largely outpaced his revenues. Despite the rather quiet end to his career, Andrea’s frescos on the walls of Santa Maria Novella’s chapterhouse document Dominican identity, preserve examples of their particular world view, and present their take on larger issues of Christian ideology. These images stand as some of western Europe’s most important achievements of late fourteenth-century painting.</h2>

      <h2>Andrea Pisano: ca. 1295 – 1348</h2>
      <p>As his surname suggests, Andrea Pisano came from the city of Pisa, located some 45 miles to the west of Florence on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea. Although not directly descended from the father-son team of <a href="insert link">Nicola</a> and <a href="insert link">Giovanni Pisano</a>, Andrea’s contributions to the legacy of fourteenth-century art are no less important than those of his more famous predecessors.</p>

      <h2>Arnolfo di Cambio: </h2>
      <p>#Arnolfo di Cambio (ca. 1240 – 1302)
##Sculptor and Master Mason</p>

<p>Although Arnolfo di Cambio is best known for his architectural achievements in Florence, the Sienese sculptor and architect (c. 1240) began as a student and assistant to Nicola Pisano, who many consider the leading figure in the art of sculpture, just as <a href="insert link">Giotto</a> was an innovator in painting. During his time under Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo helped with the construction of the reliefs for the marble pulpit of Siena Cathedral (1265) and those for the Tomb of San Dominic (1264-67). Arnolfo developed his classical style during this period and continued working in this idiom throughout his career.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Although he remained heavily influenced by Nicola Pisano in Siena, Arnolfo’s own style evolved after his move to Rome around 1277. While in the service of Charles of Anjou, Arnolfo revived the classical past in works such as the representation of the enthroned <em>French Duke</em> (c. 1280), which is thought to be one of the earliest portrait statues since ancient times, and the bronze statue of <em>St. Peter</em> for the Vatican (c. 1290), which is still venerated by pilgrims to this day. Arnolfo also carved the innovative <em>Monument to Cardinal De Braye</em> (1282) in the church of S. Domenico, Orvieto. By combining the classicist’s attention to volume and proportion with the elegance and intricacy of a Gothicizing artist, the sculptor created a theatrical scene that relates the death of the cardinal to his eternal salvation above. The style and construction that he used would influence wall tombs for over a century.</p>

<p>Arnolfo di Cambio’s two altar canopies in San Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) and Santa Cecilia in Trastevere (1293) suggest his engagement with the Rayonnant Gothic style typically associated with the patronage of Louis IX of France. While both canopies demonstrate a keen eye towards form, proportion, and geometry, the employment of lacework, intricate patterns, and columns that taper toward the top suggest an awareness of the French artistic tradition. Other works that suggest Arnolfo’s responsiveness to this style include the Ciboria at St. Paul’s (1284), the <em>Annibaldi monument</em> in Saint John Lateran (c.1290), the Crib of Santa Maria Maggiore (1285-91), and the Chapel of St. Boniface (c. 1296).</p>

<p>Although he contributed greatly to the beautification of the city, Arnolfo di Cambio lived in Florence for only a short time. Originally brought in as a consultant for the construction of the cathedral of <a href="insert link">Santa Maria del Fiore</a> in 1296 (completed only in 1436 when <a href="insert link">Filippo Brunelleschi</a> finished the famous cupola over the building’s crossing), recent research suggests that the basic layout of <a href="insert link">Santa Croce</a> was also designed by Arnolfo in 1295, and <a href="insert link">Vasari</a> attributed to Arnolfo the designs for the <a href="insert link">Palazzo Vecchio</a> (initiated in 1298). His sculpted works can be seen in the façade of the Duomo, which include the <em>Nativity</em>, the <em>Dormition</em> (destroyed), and the <em>Madonna and Child</em> (1296), as well as the effigy of the <em>Enthroned Pope Boniface VIII</em> that harkens back to Arnolfo’s images of <em>St. Peter</em> and <em>Charles of Anjou</em> in Rome.</p>

<p>For his work in Florence, Arnolfo di Cambio would be honored by the Council of One Hundred in 1300, but the artist enjoyed this prestigious award only briefly: his activity was cut short by his untimely death in 1302.</p>

      <h2>Bernardo Daddi: ca. 1280 – 1348</h2>
      <p>A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280 – 1348) became one of Florence’s most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies.</p>

      <h2>Giottino: </h2>
      <p>#Giottino (ca. 1324-ca. 1365)
##Painter</p>

<p>Giottino, also known as Giotto di Stefano, was born around 1324 and lived in Florence until his death in the 1360’s, although the exact year of his death is unknown. His father, Maestro Stefano Florentino, was a famous Florentine painter who gained painterly prominence for his naturalistic style, earning him the nickname the “Scimmia della Natura” (“Ape of Nature”). Giottino likely received painting instruction from his father, but looked strongly towards the great <a href="insert link">Giotto</a> in the formation and development of his style. Much of Giottino’s written biographical history came from the writings of Vasari in his second writings titled <em>Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Giottino’s best known works include the 1356 <a href="insert link"><em>Madonna della Sagra</em></a>, a fresco painted in a small niche carved into the side of a building in a poor district in Florence. The working-class audience in that neighborhood had complete access to this fresco and, unlike his other paintings, could see this image daily. Giottino’s <a href="insert link"><em>Pietà</em></a>, painted for the Church of <a href="insert link">San Remigo</a> between 1360 and 1365, holds the crown as his best known individual work. The <em>Pietà</em> depicts a scene with twelve people surrounding the dead body of Christ, strewn across a small bedding with his feet on the left side of the image and his head on the right. Seven of the figures kneel around his dead body and offer prayers, while the other five remain standing and look towards Christ. A cross, centered and behind the figures, moves upward through the scene towards the top of the image and emanates to the left and right, adding balance and stillness to the image. Some of the figures in the image have been identified as the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalen, and other Saints, while also depicting two figures in modern attire who were likely the donors for the image. Giottino painted the <em>Pietà</em> in a highly naturalistic style, particularly for the 14th century. He appears to possess a rich understanding of the human body and how to portray it, and utilizes a naturalistic perspective and spacing between his figures. The gold background of <em>Pietà</em> underscores the scene’s holiness, while also serving to show the sanctity of the Church of San Remigo. The <em>Pietà</em> serves as an excellent example of Giottino’s great mastery of naturalism and perspective during his generation, strongly attributed to the influence of his father and Giotto.</p>

<h2 id="although-his-work-is-often-overlooked-due-to-the-strong-artistic-innovations-and-creations-during-the-renaissance-giottino-was-recognized-in-his-own-time-as-a-master-of-his-craft-giottino-was-not-able-to-live-a-full-life-as-he-died-in-his-late-thirties-or-early-forties-from-consumption-yet-still-made-an-impressive-mark-on-trecento-florentine-art">Although his work is often overlooked due to the strong artistic innovations and creations during the Renaissance, Giottino was recognized in his own time as a master of his craft. Giottino was not able to live a full life, as he died in his late thirties or early forties from consumption, yet still made an impressive mark on Trecento Florentine art.</h2>

      <h2>Giotto di Bondone: </h2>
      <p>#Giotto di Bondone (ca. 1265 – 1337)
##Painter and Architect</p>

<p>Few artists in the history of Western Civilization have received as much attention and adulation as Giotto di Bondone, a leading practitioner of a kind of pictorial representation that critics since the time of <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari</a> have credited with initiating a New Style of Art that we now associate with the period we call the “Renaissance.” Legends surrounding his genius cropped up during his lifetime, and the productivity of his large and active workshop – which extended from the university town of Padua in Northeast Italy all the way down to Naples in the southeast – both inspired generations of imitators and fooled the eyes of generations of critics that followed: as a result, the number of paintings ascribed to his hand is probably much larger than the actual number of images for which he was truly responsible.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>His origins, like those of most of his peers, can only be guessed at. Giotto appears to have been born in or around the year 1267, and he was certainly a contemporary of the famed poet, <a href="insert link">Dante Alighieri</a> (who mentions him by name in Purgatorio XI: 91-96), the Sienese master <a href="insert link">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>, and the painter <a href="insert link">Cimabue</a>, who <a href="insert link">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> and then Vasari claimed was his master. These two artists, Cimabue and Giotto, were linked together at the height of the latter’s career. As early as 1315, Dante celebrated them in a rather backwards way by using them as examples of the fleetingness of fame, when he famously wrote:</p>

<p>O, empty glory of the powers of humans!
	How briefly does green endure upon the peak –
	Unless an age of dullness follows it.
		In painting, Cimabue thought he held
	The field, but now it’s Giotto they acclaim –
	The former only keeps a shadowed fame.</p>

<p>The connection between Cimabue and Giotto was underscored in Ghiberti’s <em>Commentarii</em> of about 1450, in which the oft-repeated legend of the older artist’s discovery of the child prodigy – drawing a picture of a sheep on a rock – was first articulated. This initial comment on Giotto’s interest in using nature as a guide became the signature theme in Ghiberti’s biography of the painter. Wrote Ghiberti,</p>

<p>“Giotto was an enormously important figure in the field of painting. He brought forth to prominence the new art, abandoning the clumsiness of the Greeks. He made towering works of greatness, especially in the city of Florence (and in many other places) and collected disciples who were, in every way, the equal of the ancients. Indeed, one sees in Giotto’s art works that his followers could not better. He elevated nature in art, and with it a certain gentility, without ignoring proper proportions and measures. He was extremely skilled in all the arts, was an inventor and discoverer of many theories which had been buried for almost 600 years. When nature wanted to concede something, it conceded without a single complaint.”</p>

<p>Embedded in his lengthier biography of Giotto is Vasari’s terse remark that Giotto, “freed himself from the rude manner of the Greeks and brought back to life the true art of painting.”</p>

<p>These legends and tropes do little to secure for us an authentic understanding of Giotto’s origins and early works. Some have connected him to the motherhouse of the <a href="insert link">Franciscan Order</a> in Assisi and have argued that he was the sole creator of a series of frescoes (produced in the 1290s) in the upper basilica that illustrate scenes from the life of the thirteenth-century saint who started the order. Indeed, a document from the <a href="insert link">church of S. Francesco</a> ambiguously places him there sometime before 1310, although it is unclear whether Giotto was then actively painting in the upper basilica or in the lower one directly beneath it. While most Anglo-American scholars reject the attribution of the St. Francis cycle to Giotto, believing them instead to have been painted either the so-called <a href="insert link">St. Cecilia Master</a> or by Roman artists at the behest of the papacy (and Giotto’s work to have been confined to a single chapel in the lower basilica), the possibility of his activity in upper church of Assisi is still celebrated by Italian scholars – and by the friars who still live and work in the cloister there.</p>

<p>By 1300 he appears to have been in Rome, where Giotto is said to have produced for <a href="insert link">Pope Boniface VIII</a> a massive mosaic dedicated to the <em>Navicella</em> that graced the façade of Old St. Peter’s basilica until its destruction in the early sixteenth century. As is the case with Giotto’s other works from this early moment in his career, the Roman project is not documented.</p>

<p>The first time Giotto’s name appears in a written record comes in 1305, when the painter was mentioned working for Enrico Scrovegni in the Paduan chapel that bears the banker’s name. Responsible for both the architectural design of that private oratory and the frescoes painted within it, Giotto efficiently completed this project in roughly two years. The so-called Arena Chapel was dedicated on the Feast of the Annunciation, March 25, 1306, and the doors of the space were opened to the public annually on that date to commemorate his achievement. Among those who almost surely saw and marveled at the paintings Giotto produced there was the Florentine exile Dante Alighieri, by then a resident of Padua on the verge of penning one of the most influential works of literature in all of human history. Dante’s conception of Hell in the <a href="insert link">Inferno</a> (initiated around 1307) seems to rely quite heavily on the zones of the damned and the grouping of punishments that appear in the imagined cauldron of Giotto’s <em>Last Judgment</em> and the damaged souls inside it that the artist painted only a few months before Dante began writing his verses.</p>

<p>Giotto then made his way to Assisi, where he oversaw frescoes in the lower basilica of S. Francesco before finally making his way back to Florence – a city he had assiduously avoided for most of the duration of the quasi-civil war there that lasted for nearly all of the first decade of the fourteenth century. By 1312 he had finished an impressive crucifix for the <a href="insert link">Dominicans</a> at <a href="insert link">S. Maria Novella</a> that served as a model for younger artists producing similar paintings for the remainder of the Trecento. In 1317, he began a lengthy project to fresco the walls of the <a href="insert link">Bardi Chapel</a> along the right transept of the Franciscan church of <a href="insert link">S. Croce</a>, with scenes from the life of <a href="insert link">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. Just before leaving for Naples in 1328, where Giotto worked for five years as the court artist of Robert of Anjou, his workshop completed frescoes that illustrated the miracles of St. John the Evangelist and St. John the Baptist in the <a href="insert link">Peruzzi Chapel</a>, adjacent to the aforementioned Bardi Chapel. The altarpiece of the <em>Coronation of the Virgin</em> was probably completed at roughly the same time, that is sometime around 1328, and has much in common with the hotly contested double-sided altarpiece that Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi commissioned from Giotto and placed in the canon’s choir of Old St. Peter’s basilica in Rome either in 1300 or in 1329. Take your pick.</p>

<p>Giotto’s work in Naples comes down to us only in the form of notices and vague archival references. The elderly artist, then in his sixties, may have painted some works for the Angevin king there, but whatever he completed was ruined by a series of earthquakes that had, by the end of the eighteenth century, utterly leveled almost the entire medieval city (and most of the artistic works that once shined inside it).</p>

<p>By 1333 Giotto was back in Florence, now feted as the official City Artist despite his advanced age. Indeed, the artist seems to have received his appointment from the city at precisely the moment of his retirement. Giotto managed to set down designs for the <a href="insert link">Campanile</a> that stands next to the cathedral’s façade, but those designs were so poorly executed that the project was halted and re-configured out of fear that Giotto’s building would completely collapse. Other than the Campanile project, Giotto pursued practically no other commissions during this final stage of his career, and it may well be that his post a City Artist was actually an administrative post (or, just as likely, merely an honorific title), and that his real job was to delegate (or even sub-contract) important commissions to younger artists like <a href="insert link">Bernardo Daddi</a> and <a href="insert link">Andrea Pisano</a>.</p>

<p>Yet Giotto’s legacy cannot be exaggerated. His approach to naturalistic figures and believable narratives catapulted Florentine art from the stodgy and predictable effigies painted by thirteenth-century artisans, deeply wedded to elongated and stylized Byzantine traditions, to a vibrant and animated visual environment that valued energy, emotional content, and gestural drama. His conveyance of mystical sublimity in <em>The Stigmatization of St. Francis</em> at the top of the Bardi Chapel, for example, succeeds due to the recognizable anatomical form that emerges from underneath Francis’ garment and the unrelenting facial expression of the elderly friar confronting his God. The emotionally fraught image of Francis’s followers who mourn his death in the <em>Burial of St. Francis</em> inside the chapel counters this image by placing around the dead saint a collection of tormented men, each one lost in his own psychological state of grief and each one contributing to the broader emotional environment created by this Greek Chorus of unified anguish, all of which has been depicted through the furrowed brows and downturned lips and thrusting hands of otherwise anonymous clerics. No one had ever seen paintings quite like this before, and their impact was immediate and pervasive, as evidenced by the legion of imitators who strove to echo his new approach to pictorial naturalism.</p>

<p>Giotto’s innovative spirit captured the imagination of writers during and after his lifetime. <a href="insert link">Boccaccio</a> famously cast Giotto in a number of his tales in the <a href="insert link"><em>Decameron</em></a> from ca. 1351, making the painter out to be a sage judge of character. <a href="insert link">Francesco Sacchetti’s</a> <a href="insert link"><em>Trecento Novelle</em></a> from the 1390s expanded on this literary trope by ascribing to Giotto a certain wit and wisdom that put the craftsman on par with Florence’s greatest minds. And Vasari’s sixteenth-century story of “Giotto’s O,” a play on Pliny the Elder’s tales (concerning the Greek painters Apelles, Parahaxios, and Protogenes) in which the artist drew a perfect circle – free hand – before an uncomprehending papal lackey, came to be seen by modern painters (like Rembrandt van Rijn) as the perfect allegory of artistic dexterity. To this day, Giotto receives a kind of adulation among Italian art lovers as a groundbreaker among groundbreakers, the first of the painterly Evangelists who, along with <a href="insert link">Masaccio</a>, <a href="insert link">Leonardo</a>, and <a href="insert link">Michelangelo</a>, proselytized a new approach to the visual arts.</p>

<p>Importantly, some of Giotto’s stylistic and intellectual innovations were disseminated even before his death. His talented workshop almost certainly included <a href="insert link">Taddeo Gaddi</a> and <a href="insert link">Maso di Banco</a>, two of the most gifted painters of the fourteenth century who gained their independence and produced important works of their own as soon as Giotto left for Naples in 1328. In fact, many of the figures and scenes credited to Giotto’s hand in the 1310s and ‘20s were, in all probability, actually executed by these great masters-in-training, thanks to the tradition of workshop production that dictated a delegation of productivity among assistants on the scaffold. But even painters who did train directly with Giotto looked to his art for inspiration. <a href="insert link">Pacino di Buonaguida</a> and Bernardo Daddi, excellent painters in their own right, quoted the details of Giotto’s passages with frequency and skill, even though they appear to have come from different pictorial traditions. Even after the passing of the <a href="insert link">Black Death</a> in 1348 – that watershed event that, at least chronologically (if not psychologically), divides the late Middle Ages from the early Modern period – Giotto’s compositions, figures, gestures, and narrative solutions still held sway among painters like <a href="insert link">Andrea Orcagna</a> and <a href="insert link">Nardo di Cione</a>, <a href="insert link">Niccolò di Pietro Gerini</a>, and even <a href="insert link">Lorenzo Monaco</a> into the fifteenth century. Only with the advent of Masaccio, the first painter of the Quattrocento to truly understand Giotto and his approach to naturalistic representation, did artists begin to build upon the traditions he had founded in the early Trecento.</p>

      <h2>Maso di Banco: </h2>
      <p>#Maso di Banco (ca. 1305 – ca. 1350)
##Painter</p>

<p>Though he only worked for a short period in the first half of the 14th century, Maso di Banco is considered one of the greatest students of <a href="insert link">Giotto</a>. Despite his illustrious teacher and accomplished personal career, almost no information remains about his life. Though it is known that he worked in Florence circa 1330-1350, none of his work was ever signed or dated, a fact which has furthered the mystery surrounding his brief career.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The frescoes of the <a href="insert link">Bardi di Vernio Chapel</a> in the Franciscan friary of <a href="insert link">S. Croce</a> are the only works attributed to him without question, a tradition informed by <a href="insert link">Ghiberti’s</a> early writings that describe Maso’s impressive skill as both a painter and sculptor, and attribute the frescoes of the chapel to him. The frescoes primarily depict scenes from the Life of St. Sylvester, but also include images of the <em>Resurrection of Christ</em> and the <em>Last Judgment</em>. The Life of St. Sylvester includes the prominent image of <a href="insert link"><em>St. Sylvester and the Dragon</em></a> on the south wall, a dramatic scene which exemplifies his clear style and illustrates the direct influence of Giotto. Both painters used a similar palette of pinks, greys, reds, and whites, as well as light and dark contrasts to convey a sense of naturalism. The legacy of Giotto can also be seen in Maso’s figures, which share the same individuality of expression. Credited with being more restrained and simpler that Giotto, Maso’s scenes dilute drama in favor of illusionistic depictions of deep space and connections to surrounding architecture. In creating these deep spaces, Maso places his figures in a way that helps suggest a certain kind of three dimensionality.</p>

<p>These stylistic tendencies reappear in the fresco on the opposite wall of the Bardi di Vernio Chapel. In the image of the <em>Resurrection</em> on the north wall, Maso placed the painted figure of the Resurrected Christ rising up over a sculpted tomb, making it seem as though the event happens before our eyes. This blending of art and its setting allows for a consistent narrative, further fueling the story and the importance of its characters, which in turn enhances the holiness of the space.</p>

<p>The little information we have about Maso includes the mention of him in guild records and registers, such as his matriculation into the <a href="insert link">Arte de’ Medici e Speziali guild</a> in 1346 and the appearance of his name in the Register of the <a href="insert link">Compagnia di S. Luca</a> in 1350. But there is no mention of him at any time after this. Given this lack of documentation, Maso di Banco’s legacy relies chiefly on Ghiberti’s accounts of his skill and range, his status as a pupil of Giotto, and most importantly his frescoes in the Bardi di Vernio Chapel.</p>

      <h2>Taddeo Gaddi: </h2>
      <p>#Taddeo Gaddi (ca. 1290-1366)
##Painter</p>

<p>Taddeo Gaddi, born circa 1290, is often described as one of the most talented artists and builders living in Florence during the medieval era. Heralded as one of <a href="insert link">Giotto’s</a> most able pupils, Gaddi exuded a reverence for his master’s stylistic technique and sought to follow the artistic method of his teacher. Sometimes this resulted in a kind of imitative quality that caused <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari </a> to comment harshly on Gaddi’s aping of Giotto’s aesthetic, stating “(Gaddi) always continued Giotto’s manner without improving it,”  a backwards compliment that suggests a slavish imitation on the part of Taddeo Gaddi.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Despite working in the shadow of his famous master, Gaddi enjoyed a successful career in art, opening his own shop and receiving some of the most lucrative commissions in all of Florence. One such commission came from the Franciscan friary in the city, where Taddeo Gaddi was assigned as chief decorator for the group’s main worship center, the Basilica of <a href="insert link">Santa Croce</a>. This ornate building contains important works by Gaddi, including his frescoes of the <em>Tree of Life</em> on the west wall of the conventual <a href="insert link">Refectory</a>, quatrefoil panels of the Life of Francis that ornamented a large cabinet, and murals for the <a href="insert link">Cappella Baroncelli (1328-1330)</a>. Annunciation and visitation scenes align the altar walls of this latter space, and the large murals present themselves to viewers in grand fashion. Iconographically, these paintings are unmistakably evocative of Giotto’s work in the Arena Chapel at Padua (ca. 1305) and this imitation showcases Gaddi’s ceaseless reliance on his teacher as a fountain for inspiration. Despite Vasari’s critique, Gaddi did not merely imitate Giotto’s style, but managed to advance his master’s groundbreaking achievements: his ability to utilize natural light and rich hues to achieve perfect representations of color, seen in the Baroncelli <em>Adoration of the Magi</em>, displays Gaddi’s mastery of the color wheel that surpasses even that of Giotto’s.</p>

<h2 id="until-his-death-in-1366-taddeo-gaddi-was-one-of-the-most-influential-men-in-florentine-artistic-culture-despite-being-viewed-as-a-simple-follower-of-giotto-taddeo-triumphantly-surpassed-his-liege-in-the-methodology-of-colors-and-light-his-work-in-the-basilica-santa-croce-provides-a-canonical-viewing-of-gaddis-copycat-style-while-also-underscoring-his-heightened-proficiency-with-color">Until his death in 1366 Taddeo Gaddi was one of the most influential men in Florentine artistic culture. Despite being viewed as a simple follower of Giotto, Taddeo triumphantly surpassed his liege in the methodology of colors and light. His work in the Basilica Santa Croce provides a canonical viewing of Gaddi’s copycat style while also underscoring his heightened proficiency with color.</h2>

<p>The south portal of the Florentine <a href="http://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu/sites/baptistery.html">Baptistery of S. Giovanni</a> was originally adorned with a wooden door. In 1322 members of the <a href="insert link">Arte della Calimala</a>, the Cloth Merchants Guild that was responsible for the building’s maintenance, upkeep, and decorations, moved to cover those doors with metal plates that they felt would act as a sign of the structure’s importance. By 1329 this approach was amended with a plan to make entirely new doors for the portal that would be made wholly of metal or brass.</p>

<p>The wall just within the confines of the <a href="insert link">Bigallo’s loggia</a> contains a now-damaged and detached fresco that probably illustrated the theme of the <em>Last Judgment</em> that artists like <a href="insert link">Nardo di Cione</a> found so appealing during the fourteenth century (figure 1). The painting faced out toward the public from the chamber just inside the entrance, positioned on its west wall and facing east toward the <a href="insert link">Campanile</a> that <a href="insert link">Andrea Pisano</a> had recently ornamented with dozens of <a href="insert link">marble reliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Framing magnificently the famed miracle-working <a href="insert link"><em>Madonna of Orsanmichele</em></a> by <a href="insert link">Bernardo Daddi</a>, Andrea di Cione’s <em>Baldacchino</em> articulated perfectly the mid-Trecento aesthetic that appealed to Florentine audiences of the day. A massive structure, carved in marble with sections of inlaid gold and mosaic tesserae sprinkled throughout, the tabernacle both framed the picture that, in 1365, was named the “official painting of Florence” and stood on its own as a cultural curiosity that brought in local and international viewers in droves (figure 1).</p>

                <p>Hello World</p>

<p>Aidan, Colby, and I have been very busy since we arrived in Florence three weeks ago. After finishing up the term in Lexington, the three of us met Professor Bent here in Florence. We hit the ground running and began photographing the Bargello the very next morning.</p>
