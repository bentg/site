      <h3>Josephs</h3>
      <p>From Dallas, Texas, Sam Joseph is a junior at Washington and Lee University. Before attending Washington and Lee, he took a gap year and lived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he taught English, cooked for and worked with orphans and in hospitals. Majoring in Art History, minoring in Classics, and focusing on his independent Engineering and Physics studies, Sam plans to attend architecture graduate school. Through Florence As It Was, Sam conducted project research in Florence, Italy. For six weeks, he worked in the Kunsthistorisches Institut library and photolibrary. He translated Medieval Latin documents and took pictures for photogrammetric modeling. As a part of Dr. Uffelman’s Technical Examination of 17th-Century Dutch Paintings course, Sam studied abroad in the Netherlands. Consequently, he has pursued the subject of digital archaeology and conservation and its relation to the Florence As It Was project. Sam headed the project’s 3D modeling division.</p>

<p>Sam created the first <a href="https://sketchfab.com/FLAW/models">models</a> for Florence As It Was, including the flagship model of the Bigallo and the numerous niches of Orsanmichele. He also helped write the FLAW guidlines and methodology, translated scholarly sources from Medieval Latin, and shaped the project’s goal from the very outset. Finally, Sam assisted in training <strong>MC Greenleaf</strong> for the 3D modeling project division.</p>

      <p>Aidan is a Medieval &amp; Renaissance Studies and Art History double-major planning to add a Classics minor this year. He has studied Italian, French, and Spanish–with Latin soon to follow–and spent the summer working on Florence As It Was and practicing his Italian in Italy. On-campus, he spends much of his time working on Digital Humanities projects involving the University’s Special Collections archives, where he worked during the summer of 2016. In Fall semester 2017 he was appointed to the Digital Humanities committee. Outside the classroom, he enjoys participating in Catholic Campus Ministry, hanging out at Friday Underground, and seeing plays at the Blackfriars in Staunton with the Shakespeare Society.</p>
