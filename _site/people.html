      <h3>Bernardo Daddi</h3>
      <p>Bernardo Daddi (d. 1348)
Painter
A late contemporary of the famous painter Giotto di Bondone, Bernardo Daddi (ca. 1280 – 1348) became one of Florence’s most popular and most important producers of panel pictures during the two decades that preceded the advent of Bubonic Plague. The identity of his master remains unclear, and speculations range from Giotto himself to obscure miniaturists like the elusive Master of the Dominican Effigies. His approach to figures and scenes belies an understanding of popular trends in Trecento painting, with a complete reliance on layered hues of egg tempera pigments creating colorful (if somewhat rigid) forms that immediately capture one’s attention. But Daddi was no slavish imitator, and he intentionally departed from the naturalistic and expressive figures produced by his more famous predecessor in his quest for painting characters deserving of devotional attention from viewers. His traditionalist, somewhat conservative approach retained much of the brilliance of earlier Tuscan painting in Florence and nearby Siena without the addition of potentially distracting gestural or overly emotional elements.</p>

      <h3>Alberto Arnoldi</h3>
      <h1 id="alberto-arnoldi-ca-1320--ca-1370">Alberto Arnoldi (ca. 1320? – ca. 1370?)</h1>
<h2 id="sculptor">Sculptor</h2>

<p>Alberto Arnoldi appears to have been born in Florence, although the date of his birth has never been discovered. Indeed, practically nothing about this sculptor of note is known, and our understanding of his work and his legacy comes down to us only circumstantially.</p>

<p>Arnoldi must have been highly regarded by his peers and his patrons. His abilities were such that the officers of the Company of the Misericordia hired him to sculpt two different projects in the late 1350s and early 1360s for their residence on the Piazza S. Giovanni, now known as the <a href="insert link">Bigallo</a> (Passerini, note 3, who cites documents contained in Archivio di Stato, Firenze, <em>Bigallo</em>, Deliberazioni dei Capitano II, II, 12). They chose him, the documents say, because they believed the quality of his sculptures would be comparable to those recently completed by <a href="insert link">Andrea Pisano</a> for the <a href="insert link">Baptistery</a> and the <a href="insert link">Campanile</a>:</p>

<p>“[The] captains of this confraternity … deliberated on the following things: First, they agreed to offer to Alberto Arnoldi, master from the parish of San Michele Berteldi, the commission to produce an image in marble of Our Lady holding her Son in her arms … with two angels…. All of these figures must be by the hand of Alberto, who shall receive a salary of 55 florins for the figure of our Lady and one hundred thirty florins for the two angels, who should be holding candles in their hands: the figure of Mary should be of a higher quality than the figure of Our Lady in Pisa. Its quality will be judged by three or four masters deemed to be qualified by the city of Florence, which shall appoint them at the time. And if it is deemed to be inferior to the one in Pisa, the Bigallo will not be obligated to keep it. And the images of the marble angels must be of the same quality and beauty of the said figure of Mary. He will be paid in the following manner: he will recieve an initial payment of one hundred gold florins, and when the figure of Our Lady has been completed to our satisfaction he will have fifty gold florins, and when he has completed the angels he will receive fifty gold florins; he will compose and install in the oratory the figures at his own expense. And the figures will be completed in two years from the time of their initiation, as indicated by the date of the first payment of one hundred florins.”</p>

<p>When work was completed in 1361, Alberto Arnoldi received his payments.</p>

<p>At precisely this time, that is in 1358, Arnoldi was selected to serve as the administrator of art works to be produced in the cathedral of Florence, the walls of which were then being built up around the old church of <a href="insert link">S. Reparata</a> (still in use despite being enveloped by the much larger <a href="insert link">S. Maria del Fiore</a> that was rising up all around it). Arnoldi must have been an artist of note.</p>

<p>However, we must temper this evaluation with important caveats. First, Arnoldi produced very few works that have survived to this day. The only works we can ascribe to him convincingly are the Madonna and Angels altar inside the Bigallo and the Madonna and Child on its façade. Were he truly a valued sculptor in that period, surely we would have more works from his hand. Second, Arnoldi’s name does not appear in documents that address the most important sculptural projects of the day: he was not involved in the production of <a href="insert link">Andrea di Cione’s</a> massive <a href="insert link"><em>Baldacchino</em></a> installed in <a href="insert link">Orsanmichele</a>, the continuation of the project to add reliefs to the Campanile, or the carving of figures for the façade of the Duomo – of which went to other people. While he obviously caught the eye of the Captains of the Bigallo, he was not considered in the same league as Andrea. And third, despite his work for the Bigallo and inside the Duomo, Arnoldi’s output was not large enough or interesting enough to warrant comment by <a href="insert link">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> in his 15th-century art history text (the <a href="insert link"><em>Commentarii</em></a>) or by <a href="insert link">Giorgio Vasari</a> in his 16th-century <a href="insert link"><em>Lives of the Artists</em></a>, both of whom devoted at least passing references to a host of other equally undistinguished craftsmen.</p>

<p>Alberto Arnoldi was the fourteenth-century equivalent of a One-Hit Wonder. The sculptures for the Bigallo are all that’s left for us to consider from his career.</p>

      <h3>Ferdinando del Migliore</h3>
      <p>Ferdinando del Migliore was born in 1628 and spent his adult life researching and writing about the history of Florence. A gifted archivist, del Migliore scoured the registers and contracts of individuals and institutions in an effort to present to his readers accurate accounts of the city’s past. In 1684 the noted historian published his most important book, Firenze città nobilissima illustrata da Ferdinando del Migliore, in which the author recreated the ancient city by examining its buildings, one by one. Using documents as the foundation of his argument, del Migliore refuted legends and hearsay that had been propagated over time and corrected them by publishing the writings he uncovered. His single volume account of Florence’s history was the model for later projects, most notably Giuseppe Richa’s multi-tome Notizie istoriche delle chiese fiorentine divise ne’ suoi quartieri, a vast eighteenth-century review of the city’s churches that depended heavily on del Migliore’s groundbreaking work.</p>
