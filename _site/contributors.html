      <h3>Sam Joseph</h3>
      <p>From Dallas, Texas, Sam Joseph is a junior at Washington and Lee University. Before attending Washington and Lee, he took a gap year and lived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he taught English, cooked for and worked with orphans and in hospitals. Majoring in Art History, minoring in Classics, and focusing on his independent Engineering and Physics studies, Sam plans to attend architecture graduate school. Through Florence As It Was, Sam conducted project research in Florence, Italy. For six weeks, he worked in the Kunsthistorisches Institut library and photolibrary. He translated Medieval Latin documents and took pictures for photogrammetric modeling. As a part of Dr. Uffelman's Technical Examination of 17th-Century Dutch Paintings course, Sam studied abroad in the Netherlands. Consequently, he has pursued the subject of digital archaeology and conservation and its relation to the Florence As It Was project. Sam headed the project's 3D modeling division.</p>
      <h4>Contributions</h4>
      <p>Sam created the first <a href="https://sketchfab.com/FLAW/models">models</a> for Florence As It Was, including the flagship model of the Bigallo and the numerous niches of Orsanmichele. He also helped write the FLAW guidlines and methodology, translated scholarly sources from Medieval Latin, and shaped the project's goal from the very outset. Finally, Sam assisted in training <b>MC Greenleaf</b> for the 3D modeling project division.</p>

    <h3>Colby Gilley</h3>
    <p>Hailing from the humid hamlet of rural Molino, FL, Colby Gilley is a current sophomore at Washington and Lee University. While he naturally gravitates towards humanities classes at W&amp;L, he is enamored by all facets of the human experience. His potential major is still undeclared, but he has pronounced his investment in the University’s community, serving as a member of the FYOC, a University Big, and a leader on the Friday Underground team. Colby appreciates dusty old bookstores, the scent of wisteria on April evenings, and the sound of a reverberated guitar.</p>

      <h3>Professor George Bent</h3>
      <p>George R. Bent received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Oberlin College in 1985 and his Ph.D in Art History from Stanford University in 1993. He came to Washington and Lee University in that year and has been a member of the faculty ever since. Bent teaches courses in Medieval and Renaissance art history, and specializes in fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century Italian art and culture. He co-founded Washington and Lee’s interdisciplinary program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, chaired it from 2000 to 2003, served as Associate Dean of the College from 2003-2006, and chaired the Department of Art and Art History from 2001 to 2003 and 2008 to 2014. A two-time holder of Fulbright grants to Italy, he has written about artistic production, the function of liturgical images, and institutional patronage in early Renaissance Florence. He addressed these subjects in his book <i>Monastic Art in Lorenzo Monaco’s Florence</i> (published in 2006) and in his DVD lecture series, <i>Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian High Renaissance</i>, produced by the Great Courses Company in 2012. He then focused his scholarly attention on the subject of art for common viewers in late Medieval Florence between 1280 and 1430: his book on this material, <i>Public Painting and Visual Culture in Early Republican Florence</i> (Cambridge University Press), was published in 2016.</p>

    <h3>Professor Erik Gustafson</h3>
    <p>Erik Gustafson received his Ph.D. from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University in 2012. Currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Art History at Washington and Lee University, he has taught at George Mason University, Fordham University, and the University of California, Berkeley, and held a Rome Prize fellowship at the American Academy in Rome from 2007-2009. An architectural historian of medieval and renaissance Europe and the Mediterranean, Erik is broadly interested in the engagement of historical viewers with architectural space. He is particularly interested in the phenomenology of historical religious experience, and in how the constant dialogue between traditions of the past and the needs of the present produced architectural culture. Erik has forthcoming articles on Franciscan architecture as charismatic space and on a Crusader portal reused on a Mamluk madrasa in Cairo, and is completing a monograph entitled Building Franciscanism: Space, Tradition, and Devotion in Medieval Tuscany.</p>

                <h3>Katherine's Update</h3>
                <p>Hello again, world wide web! I have been busily working away on learning the basics of web design and translating Paatz. The Paatz translation has taken me quite some time as it is my first ever official translation. I have been working with Professor Paul Youngman our German Department to untangle the couple’s particularly convoluted sentences.</p>
