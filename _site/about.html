<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The city of Florence grew by the banks of the Arno River over the course of two millennia. At first a small ancient village, the town was reconfigured by Roman urban designers in the familiar grid pattern that marked most communities under their domain. That central core represented the city center until the late Middle Ages, when two new sets of walls – one outside the other – rose up in the thirteenth century to gird its expanding physical contours. Buffeted by an enormously successful entrepreneurial spirit, the city’s prosperity translated into a vibrant social and political entity, marked by abundant architectural enterprises that transformed it into one of Europe’s most important and desirable destinations. By 1300 the city was in the midst of a vast urban renewal program that dotted its landscape with major monuments that still stand today: by 1350 it was the most important political player in central Italy, despite the ravages of bubonic plague that had recently swept through its streets: by 1400 it claimed to be the inheritor of Rome’s republican legacy, and not without justification: by 1450 only Venice could rival its prestige and importance.</p>
<p>As Florentines traded goods, made money, and influenced international events, their fellow writers penned poems and novels, their painters frescoed walls, and their sculptors carved effigies and scenes with surprising ingenuity. Chroniclers described spaces. Merchants kept diaries. Lovers exchanged letters. Preachers described sinners and their sins. Tax collectors recorded the contents of houses, the locations of farms, and the names of owners, renters, and the dependents inside them all. The skein of data contained in all of these lasting forms of cultural documentation present an unusually complete, 360° view of the old city for the pleasure of scholars, students, and amateurs alike.</p>
<p>Never before, however, have we been able to meld together the data contained in these visual and textual documents with the physical remnants of the medieval city in which they were produced. Instead they have come to us in detached form, separated physically and contextually from their original settings. We have depended on our collective imaginations to recreate that environment, that world, for centuries.</p>
<p>Technological advances have changed all this. Thanks to the industries of computer scientists, professional game designers, and experimental entrepreneurs, we have at our fingertips the capacity to recreate the physical environment of the old city of Florence at a time when its residents bought their food and clothes at outdoor markets, attended church daily, and repeatedly faced down threats of famine, disease, and warfare. Florence As It Was has as its mission the gradual reconstruction of this major cultural center, one structure at a time, city block by city block. Paintings produced by artists during the early period that feature buildings constructed before 1500 – including those that no longer survive – have been used to recreate the exteriors of churches, municipal offices, and city gates. Using extant architectural evidence, documents, art images, and contemporary representations, we will build a three dimensional model that will allow viewers to circumambulate a structure, venture inside it, and see stitched onto its walls and furnishings the images that once adorned it. Embedded into this reconstructed structure will be texts – in their original language with English translations – that help explain how and why a specific object looks the way it does, why a specific artist was commissioned to produce it, and/or the motives behind its commission from the vantage point of its patron. Literary passages, tax records, even musical performances will be accessed through clicks on ‘hotspots,’ allowing writers and notaries and musicians to speak for themselves. Hyperlinks to other reconstructed buildings will allow us to make connections, literally, to other spaces and the people who occupied them.</p>
<p>One of the many great challenges has been determining which moment to select as our historical cut off. Indeed, the city changed over time in a fluid manner: it never stopped evolving. We could have easily selected 1572, 1498, or 1492 as our specific moment; we could have just as easily selected 1300, 1348, or 1436. In the end, we decided on the date of 1492 – the year that Lorenzo the Magnificent died suddenly (at the age of only 43) and a complete inventory of Medicean possessions was drafted to itemize his holdings. Pope Alexander VI, of the notorious Borgia family, was installed as pontiff that year, while his fellow Spaniards, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, eagerly awaited news from an Italian explorer named Cristofero Colombo who had left Europe with three ships charged with the task of finding a direct route to India. In Florence, the dome of the cathedral stood like a beacon to visitors from miles away, while the legacies of Giotto, Donatello, and Leonardo da Vinci were squarely on view in chapels and on altars all across the city. Street tabernacles and cult images abounded. Bridges spanned the river. Confraternities tended to the destitute. Although Milan was now a Florentine ally, Rome and its mercenaries still posed a threat to Florentine sovereignty. The Medicean construction of Florence would collapse two years later – thanks to a foreign (French) threat that resulted in the expulsion of Lorenzo’s son, Piero, and the creation of the short-lived Florentine republic – but that was an unforeseen eventuality.

1492 it is, for better or worse.

<h2>Maps:</h2>
<p>Any number of maps would be useful tools in this endeavor. The abundance of satellite photographs of the 21st-century city surely allow us to determine contours and boundaries that have changed only minimally over time. The Duomo stands today in exactly the same place it did in 1436 and the configuration of the Arno River – despite Leonardo da Vinci’s best efforts – hasn’t shifted very much since the middle of the fourteenth century (despite Mother Nature’s most vicious efforts to the contrary). The grid pattern of the Roman city remains in the paved streets that now follow those alleys and even the design of the third ring of walls, completed at the very end of the thirteenth century, may be traced easily by following the viale that surrounds its core.</p>
<p>But that said, much has changed.</p>
<p>The old mercantile center of the medieval city, known as the Mercato Vecchio (or “Old Market”), demolished at the end of the nineteenth century to make room for the Napoleonic Piazza della Repubblica, for reasons of hygiene and aesthetic appeal. Some of the streets at the edges of the Roman grid have been widened in places to accommodate transportation needs. The Via Calziauoli is wider now than it was in 1300. Modern structures – most notably the train station that stands to the west of S. Maria Novella – obviously obscure our picture of the old city. And the ravages of time – some of them expedited by the horrors of war, the pettiness of arsons, and the ambitions of tyrants – have destroyed entirely whole sections of pre-modern Florence: of the five bridges that once spanned the Arno River, only the Ponte Vecchio survives intact.</p>
<p>We have therefore combined with contemporary satellite images a set of maps produced in the 18th and 19th centuries that, we believe, present a fairly accurate representation of the urban landscape of Florence. The alleyways of the Mercato Vecchio, for example, have been reproduced according to designs made by Guido Carocci that currently adorn the consultation room of the Archivio di Stato in Florence. A useful model of that central area of the city survives in the museum of the Palazzo Vecchio. We have combined these early maps and models with cityscape paintings by relatively unknown artists (like the nineteenth-century amateur, Fabio Borbottoni) to understand the appearance of piazzas, building facades, and structural elevations. </p>

<h2>Anticipated content:</h2>
<p>One structure at a time, the reconstruction of Florence As It Was will combine an interactive map with three-dimensional representations of buildings, designed according to measurements gleaned from the scholarly literature and on-site examinations. Layered onto in into these reconstructions will be images of original works of art situated in the places that contemporary users of the building described them (the photographs of which are in the public domain). Hot spots throughout these buildings and images will direct viewers to selected documents, descriptions, and interpretations – some of them translated into English from their Italian, Latin, and German – that help us understand the messages, functions, uses, and reception of art and architecture in the past. We imagine a day when technological advances will allow us to take a Virtual Reality tour through these buildings that enables us to recreate the visual experience of a fifteenth-century Florentine. </p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There is no way for a virtual model to match the vibrancy of a living, breathing city. Our mission is not to offer an alternative to the city of Florence, but rather a way of understanding what remains of the lost urban environment in the context of its original appearance and its original residents. The results are, of course, imperfect, and we take full responsibility for any errors herein. We also invite and encourage suggestions to improve this content, both technologically and from a scholarly perspective.</p>
