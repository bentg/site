Welcome to Florence As It Was' digital museum! Here you will find a curated selection of the models we have created.

Our models often fall under multiple categories, and therefore can be found alongside various related artworks. For example, you may compare Verrocchio's *Doubting Thomas* with the rest of the artist's oeuvre, or alongside its fellow statues at Orsanmichele.

<!-- Sort by:

Artist
Building
Patron?
Etc.
Perhaps make use of a carousel menu selection for each?
