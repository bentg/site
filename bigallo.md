Building History

Oratorio of the Bigallo (Corner of Via dei Calzaiuoli and Piazza di San Giovanni) (4). The company of the Misericordia, a confraternity, acquired the building in 1321 (5). After they acquired the property through a donation of the adjoining plots in 1351, (6) they began building the building in 1352, which contained a loggia, an oratory, meeting hall, living room for the brothers of the confraternity (7). By 1358 the building process was completed (8). The design can be, in all likelihood, attributed to the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who also provided the most important three-dimensional fixtures (9).

In 1425, under the oversight of Cosimo de'Medici, the brotherhood of the Compagnia della Misericordia united with the the original, long-time resident of the building, the brotherhood of Santa Maria del Bigallo, jointly receiving the residence of the latter through a co-ownership agreement (10). Constructional changes were apparently not undertaken at that time. A fire in 1442 damaged only the upper floor of the building (11). In 1452 the salla della udienza was expanded through the inclusion of a new room (12). Since the 1700s multiple disfiguring changes to the building were undertaken. In 1698 the arcade of the loggia and the window in the upper floor were walled up (13). After termination of the Bigallo's management in 1776, the building was given as the site of the administration for the state orphanage and it was restored from this misunderstood event (14). In 1865 they removed the walls from the arcade of the loggia and restored the interior of the oratory (15). In 1882 the walled up windows on the upper floors were re-opened (16); a final restoration took pace in 1904 (17).

exterior
The building abuts the neighboring houses to the the south and west. Its northern façade included three niches, with one on the eastern wall. These and the eastern niche of the northern area were designed as a square loggia, which served as exhibition space for foundlings. The two round-arched openings of the porch were framed through two-story pillaster pairs and a cornice; a corresponding system of two-story pillasters and rounded arches were superimposed on two remaining bays in the north wall (18). Each of the bays contains ??? joined by a pointed arch with broad architraves and striated frames; the last bay contained an arched window (19). 

Above the ground floor pilasters articulate a mezzanine floor, in which lifelike[?] and picturesque decorations reside. 

Also the above floor is articulated through pilasters: on the north wall there are three boxes, on the east wall one; every one of these boxes contains a round arch combined with a bifurcated window. On the pilasters, the springing level of the windows are connected by a shelf, and sit carved with volutes furnished by girders, which protrude out supported by rafters.

the loggia
By Alberto Arnoldi (see building history). A highlight of the lavish decorative style, Andrea Orcagna's famous tabernacle in Orasnmichele would have been well known. Alberto Arnoldi, like Orcagna a sculptor-architect, had incorporated Orcagna's style even during the building's development. The pillars stand on plinths made of marble slabs, which contain vivid, grooved quatrefoils; in the each of the arcade's openings stands another square marble slab with a rose window of individual work. The outer pilaster pairs are also adorned with quatrefoils; on the inner pillars and the arches the quatrefoils are somewhat bigger and contain half-length figures (see facilities). In the embrasures of the arcade stand rotated, with ornamental foliate pillars, continue in the archivolt as rotated bead molding. The flat pilasters against the arches are ornamented with moulding strips; on their starting points are flat corbels with leaf work (20).

The interior of the logger is simpler; The numerous bases run along the thin shelf, where there are also continuous pilasters. Between these are located wide niches, in which are lintels with decorated, screened pointed arches and quatrefoils. The niches are closed with rounded arches; between these arches and the pointed arched ribbed vaults, there emerge spandrels from each ornamental circle.

interior
The oratory belonged to a rare types of large, arched, gothic churches; see San Jacopo in Campo Corbolini, San Martino della Scala, and San Carlo Borromeo I. There were two pointed, overlaid, ribbed arches, supported by broad and flat, splayed corner panels that compose pilasters. The rose windows in the north wall were extended in 1865; at the same time the arcade of the loggia had windows installed. 

Facilities

exterior
The three-dimensional decorations were concentrated in the entrance hall, which were designed by the architect Alberto Arnoldi, who was also a sculptor, presented as preserved gems of gothic building decoration, which proved rare in trecento Florence. The execution is often rough, as there were certainly assistants involved.The very meaningful invention but based on a foundation of antiquated taste, which knowingly came out of out of a gothic program, independent of the gothic forms that had been traditionally followed.

entrance hall
In the quatrefoil of the inner pillaster pairs and the arches of the half-figures; on the east side eight prophets, in vertex of the arcade the man of sorrows; on the north side eight angels and the savior.In the gusset of the arcade: the four cardinal virtues; on the north side justice and courage, on the east side wisdom and temperance (21).

On the interior of the loggia are the niches and the embrasures, close over the cornices, four pairs of masks with attached leaves, apparently from other hands from the remaining sculptures.

upper floors and the north side
Over the loggia stand half life-sized stone figures: Madonna with Child, the Holy Peter Martyr and Lucy; Florentine from the second half of the 14th century (22). The three canopies from 1413 were associated with Filippo di Cristofano (23). Between the canopies are frescoes of worshipping angels from around 1425 (25). In the middle bay sat a bust of the Madonna with Child by Alberto Arnoldi from 1361. Over the blind arcade on either side of the bays, show frescoes depicting Peter Martyr presenting banners to twelve followers of the company of the Misericordia; miracles by the preaching of Peter Martyr; of Ventura di Moro and Russell di Jacopo Franchi, 1445/6; very badly destroyed and restored in 1882 by Gaetano Bianchi (26). The remaining paint -- ornaments and figures in quatrefoils -- originate in the restoration of the 19th century.

Notes
(1) So was the building named, before the Company of the Bigallo received joint owenership in 1425.
(2) Del Migliore 1684
(3) Richa VII, 1785, 251. The name Bigallo is alleged by a hospital of this name by Ruballa (sped ale di S. Maria a Fonteviva, named del Bigallo), that the Compagnia Maggiora della Vergine heard, first from this and then was transferred from their residence; see Richa VII, 1758; research on G. Florenze IV, 1908, 426 and History of Florence II, 1908.
(4) the History of the Compagnia della MIsericordia is often falsely described, where they are confused with the Compagnia del Bigallo, which existed separately until 1425 separately existed. The Compagnia della misericords was first mentioned in documentation around 1321 (see the following notes). After the "Liber Chronicorum" the holy Anthony (ed. Giunti 1486, Vol III, Part III, Chapter VII, p. 233) would have arisen out of the 1292 founding of the Laudese Brotherhood from Orsanmichele; see Passerini, Stab., 1853, 446f., the erroneous assumption, the company was first mentioned in 1329. Other legendary founding stories mentioned in the Illustrated Florence, 1847, 49ff. and by Passerini, Stab., 1853, 440 ff..
(5) Poggi, Riv. D'A. II, 1904, 194 note, after the Spogli Strozzi. Richa VII, 1758, 268 dated the acquisition of the early Baldinuccio Adimari describing the houses from "around 1340."
(6) Document from 9.16.1351 by Poggi, Riv. D'A. II, 1904, 225/6; see also Passerini, Notes., 1853, 448.
(7) Document from 1.28.1352 (building beginning) by Poggi, Riv. D'A. II, 1904, 226; unknown by Passerini, Note., 1853, 449/450.
(8) By this year, the grids of the loggia are already manufactured; Document by Poggi, Riv. D'A. II, 1904, 226.
(9) Vasari I, 302 named as the architect Niccolo Pisano; he followed Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII. In contrast Passerini appealed, Note., 1853, 449-450 with the references to the chronological contradictions he thought, Andrea Orcagna was the architect. Bruckhardt, Cicerone, 1860, 145 remembered the followers of Orcagna. Frey, Loggia de'Lanzi, 1885, 105 law against the possibility that Orcagna would have been an influence to the architect of the Bigallo (Tabernacle in Orsanmichele). Frey also thought older components out of the building could have been withdrawn;  the structures of both western arcades and pilasters remembered him in the similar building style as Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, and so he came this assumption, that the rest of the old oratorio, the same as Arnolfo di Cambio, would have been constructed (Frey a. a. O. 86, 105). In Contrast Poggi turned around, Riv. D'A. II, 1904, 193/4 could rightly be said that the Brotherhood resided in this location first in 1321 (see Note 5) and that furthermore the construction planning allowed no elimination of older parts. Also Poggi advocated for the first of Frey's expressed opinions, that Alberto Arnoldi had been the builder. Venturi, Storia IV, 1906, 684: by Arnoldi under the influence of Orcagna; Thieme-Becker I, 1907, 218: as well s L. Beccherucci, Arte XXX 1927, 214: Arnoldi the architect of the Bigallo's loggia.

(19) The windows were expanded in 1865; see Poggi, Riv. d'A II, 1904, 196.
(20) It is uncertain if the figures should stand there.
(21) The three dimensional decoration were attributed first by Frey, Loggia de'Lanzi, 1885, 105 to Alberto Aroldi; Poggi, Riv. d'A II, 1904, 193, presumed -- certain with right -- that assistants were also acting on it.

(22) The three statues originate from the old oratory of the Brotherhood of the Bigallo (see Bigallo II0 and was transferred here in 1425. They were painted by Ambrogio di Baldese in 1392, see Poggi, Riv. d'A II, 1904, 230/231 (Documents) and 192/193 -- from Vasari I, 302 the Niccolo Pisano attribution; also Landini, Bigallo, 1779, XIII: Milanesi-Vasari I, 302 brought the statues mistakenly with documentation mentioning the works of Filippo di Cristofano (1413) in connection (see next note); so also Swarzenski, Kunstgeschichte Anz.
